shuzou matuoka
ihara says that curiously he stopped to sleepwalk after that, probably because of the shock of it.
after thinking deeply, ihara delivers his conjecture:
2: other events suggesting his sleepwalking were no more than circumstance evidences.
3: therefore, kimura might have committed the murder, having framed ihara.
during his speech, ihara has gradually begun to stare his face.
detecting his intense glare, kimura leaves there awkwardly.
left alone, ihara muses:
"now after so many years, i can't nothing but appraise his ingenuity.
he might have changed his name as well as his deformed face."

yesterday was white day, which is the day men or boys who got gifts from female on valentine's day give them something in return.
my son got some, too, so i drove him to the girls' houses after work.
when we got home, the three-brother-boys who my daughter gave coockies were standing out side of our entrance in the dark.
i was frightened by them because i didn't expect anyone there that late and they didn't move but just standing there watching us.
my daughter gave them home-made coockies but they gave my daughter so many stuff; such as a bottle filled with candies, hand towel, strawberries.
according to their mother, she's trying to teach them that gentlemen should return to girls three-time of what they got.
the brothers have lots of friends everywhere and have got so many on valentine's day, so i wonder how many gift she prepared.
i like chocolates and alcohol, but once i have them, i will definitely want them next day, and i would keep having them every day...

handwriting
students have to make her speech in every class on wednesdays.
so i asked the new student if she had finish to put her idea together, organized and made a draft.
she immediately opened her notebook and i found that a few sentences had been written on it.
instantly, i translated them in japanese and she jotted down my sentences.

sometimes, i hear the music like an auditory hallucination even though the dumb waiter doesn't sound the music actually.
i referred to certain people who don't say it to certain people even though they say it to some people.
i'm grateful to them for their kind comments.
her comment sounds like she didn't like me to write such a entry.
it's pity to read such an entry."
"yeah, she is right" i think i wouldn't feel bad if i didn't correct them anymore.
however, this sounds like negative thought to me.
you say "thank you" and the person who is told would be happy and they say "thank you" to others.
i wish many people in the world would feel the same!
i know that it would be impossible to make all people in the world feel the same as me, but without doing anything, nothing would happen, so i want to try.
however, this sounds like negative thought to me.
i'd like to try to make better corrections, and then, they might feel like "thank you" is coming out naturally.
you say "thank you" and the person who is told would be happy and they say "thank you" to others.
i saw a shocking news just now.

i think many japanese don't want to make futon dirty, so we tend to take a bath at night.
soaking in a hot bath is relaxation and you can clean your bodies before you go to sleep.
even so, i feel that it takes too much my whole family to take a bath every night.
in my family's case, we fill a lot of hot water with the bathtub but i recycle it when i do the laundry for conservation of resources.
however, not all of japanese do so.

it was wireless earphones released by apple.
i paid jpy 18,000 for that.
i thought it was kind of pricey to get it compared to other earphones.
as soon as i bought it, i put the earphones on, and played a music, and i felt like it's just same as others, there is no special functions with it.
i thought why did i get it, i shouldn't have got it.
however, after i used it for a couple of weeks, it became really useful to me.
i realized that there is a only few differences between the earphones and other earphones, one of which is no cable with the thing that i can operate my phone without touching since it's linked to the phone.
when you knock the earphones twice, it activates the siri that allows us to make a call, and listen to a music, which is something that other earphones can not do.

vancouver is a good city?
i've been wanting to take a trip abroad recently since it took a pretty long time since i had done last time.
i also want to check and improve my english skill by talking to foreign people.
i thought about countries which i should go to.
my wife suggested hawaii, but i didn't agree with it because many people speak japanese there.
i've been wanting to visit australia for a long time since i had heard of the country from my ex-coworker who had taken a trip there.
his story and pictures that he showed me was exciting for me.
i don't like a cold weather, so i gave up that idea.
i could go see them and have the local cuisine.
but, i turned down the idea because my wife suggested visiting there with the whole family next year.
i've watched on tv that a train ran through a vast forest.
i decided that i'll definitely get the train someday at that time.
so, i'm going to start planning to take a trip to vancouver, and then get the train.
however, i think there is a huge difference between tourist and traveller.
a tourist gets superficial impression about place which he visits.
he doesn't try to immerse deep into a new city or place, because he travells for stereotypes which are imposed by mass-culture.
conversely, a traveller explores and discovers something new for itself.
a traveller think that travelling is not only the way to know the world, but know yourself.
here is my personal tips on a good travelling:
you won't see a real life there.
a real life is what you want to see, isnt't it?
try to feel city or place which you visit.
when you take a photo, you are focusing on this process, but not on the getting your impressions.
our impressions are these things, which will be with us forever and it more valued and important than any photo.
you can't visit everything for a short time and turmoil won't benefit for your journey.
there are a lot of people who love to travel and a well-known list "i was here" is seemed as personal life achivements.

no sooner had nolan stepped into the room than sidney yelled, "welcome to joan's concentration camp, buddy!" upon seeing several prisoners and piles of paper on the long desk, nolan understood what happened.
i think that, as it was thousands of years ago with another societies, modern society is very influenced by idols, in this case, celebrities.
nowadays, it is more easy to see what our favorite celebrities are doing, it is enough with sign up on instagram or snapchat and see what they actually do in their daily life.
my brother is hungry, probably i'll finish later.
good evening, it was ages that i hadn't logged in lang8.

i need a native english support.
thus, i reminded lang8.
my goal is write every night something and receive feedback.
no vocabulary while writing.
it isn't worth it to wake up before you alarm goes off.

positive parenting after separation
mom and dad used to hate each other but they didn't divorce.
dad went to have a second wife and left us.
i think he didn't care about us, he even didn't spend a penny for us.
all he wanted was to revenge my mum at any cost, even if that cost was us, his children.
all i remember about dad and mom is fights, screams, loud voices and beat.
once time, mum, sister and i travelled to aswan to visit my grandma there.
when we returned, we found my dad change the door's lock.
he refused to open the door for us so we had to stay the night at our neighbour's home.
although all these bad experiences, i sometimes feel i miss him.
on the other hand, even mum was good, but we are not friends.
i also woke up very late this morning because my daughter took a day off due to the graduate ceremony of her junior school and i didn't need to bring her to the school bus stop this morning.
the final meeting today had been planned to take just one hour, but it eventually took more than 2hours....
the boss told him many instructions.
at the end of the meeting, the boss told us stay the meeting room and called the other teammate.
the teammate brought one whole cake mad by the very expensive and popular patissier.
if i are him, i cry because it was just after my boss got angry.
responsible, efficient, have analytical thinking, is able to solve complex problems.
in my eyes, the context within which we live is a main reason that might make us feel worse psychologically.
the individuals around us can push us to feel down, as well as the circumstances we live through have a vital effect.
on the other hand, i don't think poverty by itself is a reason.
however, i agree that the way we think and ruminate on our life and experiences shape a vital element in making us feel depressed or not in the mood.
for example, a lot of poor people don't suffer psychologically as they are satisfied with their own life, while others who are much better economically, face troubles in accepting their life the way it is.
regarding the factor that can alleviate these issues, is support which is a very crucial solution to help people to change their style of thinking.
to find those who make you feel capable and strong enough to overcome your own struggle.
to have those who give you positive energy to go on in your life journey.
talking about myself, i pass through a crucial phase of my life.
i have to make a decision either to continue my current way or to start over a new career with a lot of study, money and efforts.
aside from my personal life that i don't feel comfortable with.
so far, i cannot make my mind as i'm this kind of person who needs to be pushed and charged to start over something new.
those who are around me all that they do is to blame me, and told me it's too late to make changes in my life.
they force me to ruminate on the past opportunities that i let them go.
i know i'm the only one who can decide it but it's not easy with all this blame and overthinking.
i just need to feel relieved and relaxed so i can make my mind which is impossible in the atmosphere where i live now.
even taking the first steps and making a schedule to start studying and brush up spanish find it really hard to do.
so what is in my mind now is asking myself a lot of what ifs
it means that youth has an excellent opportunity to improve its knowledge without boring lessons or wasting time for getting to classrooms.

there had more or less 90000 households which used that method.
the less popular technology for watching tv was internet.
in 2006, the broadcast was less used than cable and satellite.
the cable was the most common with 100000 households.
in 2009, internet, with 120000 households, was become the most popular way to watch television while the use of broadcast and cable decreased strongly with 90000 and 40000.

the vocational training takes place on the one hand in the company and on the other hand in the vocational school.
in the company, you are 40 hours a week and therefore 8 hours a day.
at the vocational school 8 classes of 45 minutes each take place in theoretical lessons.
in order to pass the training, exams must be taken at the end.
the examinations and the monitoring of the training run over the chamber of industry and commerce.
at the vocational school you have subjects like for example social studies, ethics, german and english language as well as word and data processing.
in the company one has different tasks, for example dealing with incoming and outgoing mails, sort and file away documents, organize different evevents and taking the minutes.
my favorit subject is german because i like to learn something new about spelling and grammar.
at the company i enjoy preparing and participating in events best because it is very diverse and, unlike the paperwork, it provides a bit variation.
lately i bought a macbook for studying web design.
current my job is not related with professional use of design, but someday i would like to have such job.
what is difference between consist and contain?
i remember as if it were yesterday when i first listened to dire straits.
i was at a party when i heard a breathtaking solo guitar.
since then, my dream was always to attend one of its concerts.
dire straits had given many concerts in my city but for one reason or another, it had never been possible for me to attend one of their shows.
i had been waiting for more than 30 years and now my dream was going to come true.
however, i started having doubts about whether or not after having expected for so long, the concert would really live up to my expectations.
the evening of the event, i put on my old black leather jacket and went to the football stadium where the concert was to take place in.
when the concert began everything and everybody around me disappeared.
there was nothing but the group and me.
however, the best was yet to come; the solo guitar that i had heard that very first day was longer and more intense than in any of their albums.
if i had to choose a single word to describe this experience, that would be undescribable.
in a nutshell, that day i learnt that no matter how well music sounds in the comfort of your own home, there is nothing like attending a concert.
musicians playing live always go the extra mile to satisfy their audience.
however, i started having doubts about whether or not after having expected for so long, the concert would really live up to my expectations.
in a nutshell, that day i learnt that no matter how well music sounds in the comfort of your own home, there is nothing like attending a concert.
in january, i went to lithuania on business trip.
it's shameful to say, but i had very limited knowledge of lithuania then.
even the name of the capital vilnius, i couldn't spell it.
almost only thing i knew well was that a japanese diplomat chiune sugihara who served as acting consul in kaunas.
he risked his carrier, but took the the action to protect every individual indispensable life.
this story was famous in japan and there is even a movie about it.
so i had wanted to ask some lithuanians if they knew something about sugihara or japan since i came to lithuania.
i couldn't believe the answers i could get because they were more than i had expected.
of course, she knew sugihara and heard of the whole story.
thinking of the lithuanian situation where many highly educated master graduates have to work as clerk in apparel shop or in fast food chain shops, it could be taken granted for that a lithuania working at one of the japanese leading companies had a profound knowledge of history.
but what if around 20 years guys who were not interested in school subjects could know sugihara and tell me the history eloquently.
maybe around thirty past four o'clock.
i had to stay up and work all night to fulfill the all tasks by the deadline.
by four o'clock i managed to have all tasks done and the only things left was to print out 50 each of 5 different documents and bring them to the headquarter by taxi.
by 20 minutes before the deadline all copies was done, but 50 more copies of an additional document sent from estonia suddenly needed bringing to the headquarter together with the other documents.
it takes 8 minutes by taxi from my workplace to the headquarter.
so i thought then there were still 20 minutes left and i could make it.
the extra copies were done as well 5 minutes after then, i rushed to the entry where a taxi was supposed to wait for me.
when i look back on it now, it still makes my heart be beating.
if i could have called another taxi, i was told to have waited for it for 15 minutes.
it could never make it by my deadline.
that's why i thought i had to catch a taxi driving on the street along my workplace, but there was dark outside at twenty five past four o'clock in the morning and i didn't see something move.
for only a moment i could fortunately see a faint light in the darkness in a parking area of supermarket.
i was acting in instinct.
there was only 5 minutes left until deadline, so i didn't have any choice but run to catch the possibility still left.
the faint light was actually a car light and it was almost teenagers those who were eating early breakfast in the car.
i explained to them that i had to bring my documents to headquarter as soon as possible and asked if they could drive me there.
they were first confused, but i was not sure if they felt my sense of crisis and they accepted my offer soon after that.
what made me most surprised was that even these guys knew sugihara and told me that almost all lithuanians get to know him before you start to learn him and the story in a history class.
we arrived at the headquarter and i tried to pay somewhat, but they never took the money i gave them.
story they told and their kindness made me beating heart very calmed.
have hoy ever been in jail?
fourtin persons have not been in jail.

as a result, it is not easy to choose one of them so quickly.
but this song have not been sung recently.
probably,the lyrics of this song expressing students' gratitude for their teachers would fit with the times.
i took my motorcycle to the public inspection place for the periodic vehicle inspection required by the japanese regulation.
almost users of vehicles ask the dealers of vehicles to pass the periodic vehicle inspection.
though i did it by myself.
of course, i made it.
the reason why i did it by myself is for the least cost.
it cost me about $200 included taxes and the mandatory vehicle liability insurance and the inspection fee.
if you ask the dealer of vehicles it, you will pay them more than $600.
i think it is waisting.
and i wanna say in a loud voice it is very easy.
it was very warm.
i went to the park with my children today.
they sweated and played.
we played out of a lot.
my grandmother cooked for dinner today because, she gave the radished from the landlord.
it mixied with rice and boiled.
making fire wood
i made fire woods with my wife today.
it was little bit hard for me to make fire woods with using heavy ax.
finally i could made many fire woods.
but it got warm today.
maybe the woods i made is for next winter..
today, i run for 8km.
the pace is about 6 minutes per km.
it was slow pace and the perpose is recover from fatigue.
the goal of this month is to run 200km and build up physical strength.
i run for 10km yesterday and the pace is about 4'30" per km.
i was tierd and i had to recover from fatigue.
if i don't do that, i may hurt and i maynot run for a short while.
it is a waste of time.
i think practice schedule is important to achieve my goal.
i enjoy the process to achieve my goal.
after work, i went to a department store to buy cakes for my sister-in-law and four nieces who gave my father boxes of chocolates on last february 14th.
there were many men buying cakes or cookies at a confectionery section.
i just want to be a receiving side.
too hard to learn something after working

there are also have many interesting activities and a lot of beautiful flowers.
people held tet for everyone to rest, enjoy spring.
this is the time for people living at different parts of country gathering and spending time together.
english or other languages
i really understand learning english is important, but sometimes it seems to be too much emphasized.
do japanese people need english in the first place?
we see many foreigners who are non-native english speakers in our town, but students have to learn only english seriously.
some students lose interested in english as they get a low score on the test.
english education in japan drives students into a corner and makes them dislike english.
students who fail to learn english have a possibility to master other languages.
i think that japanese junior high and high schools should provide students more opportunities to learn other languages such as chinese and portuguese.
thak you for reading.

today, we had a farewell party for retired coworker.
they will retire due to retirement age.
he likes reading comic books, he used to buy it every month.
sometimes if they didn't sell in his city, he would take the train to another city to buy it.
most of his salary was spent on it.
i think it's good for someone to have a hobby, but i think helen's grandpa is not suitable for marriage.
today i met up a friend helen.
she has a job interview of teacher tomorrow.
she had her hair gray colored.
she didn't want to do so, because she thinks if she teaches well, that enough to take her in.
she intends to apply for the job of chinese teacher, but she wants more to be a math teacher, but she is afraid that she can't teach math as well as chinese.
today i met up a friend helen.
she has a job interview of teacher tomorrow.
she had her hair gray colored.
someone suggested her to return the hair to the normal color, because it gets closer to the image of a teacher.
she didn't want to do so, because she thinks if she teaches well, that enough to take her in.
she intends to apply for the job of chinese teacher, but she wants more to be a math teacher, but she is afraid that she can't teach math as well as chinese.
i accompanied my friend helen to go home.
to the place she lives in we have to take a small lane.
it's dark and narrow.
besides, it has too much curves.
on the road a strange thought came to my mind that in china, there are many disappeared every year.
once hidden, maybe during a long time there wouldn't be anyone to discover it.
it might take me more time to go back home, but i wouldn't be scared.
i picked up 100 dollars at night on the street in front of a train station after my japanese class finished.
i waited for a while but no one came, so i planed to sent it to the police, and then i
i told them about the windfall and we all agreed that even i send it
to the police, they still can not find the owner.
it happened that all of us were starving, so we decided to have a drinking party using that money.
to be honest, if i picked up a purse, i would of course send it to the police no matter how much money in it.
since it's just 100 dollars, i would keep it and feel sorry for the owner.
i decided to go the dentist today.
i had two decay teeth.
it made me headache.
in this video, i will speak about the first three steps that you should follow if you want to become fluent in spanish.
my favorite manga is decided to animeted!
it was a manga that started about 20 years ago, and i knew that manga was already completed.
since it is an old manga, i was giving up animeted.
although it's a personal opinion, i feel that the manga is somehow linked with fullmetal alchemist.
if you like fullmetal alchemist, you may enjoy that animation.
thanks for reading my post; i appreciate your help!
mind fullness
i bought a book about "mind fullness".
it is a good way to take a break for our brain.
we use our brain a lot automatically.
it makes our brain tired.
when we do "mind fullness", we focus on present.
it is good to relax our mind.
people pushes us in many ways.
a lot of times we are forced to tell lies instead of being we ourselves.
in some sense that is normal, is a question of necessity.
as a social animal species, we usually have a necessity of belonging.
to belong to a specific circle, class or clan.
but is it fare in an open-minded society?
who do not know 'a friend of' one's self that, for example, has an uncommon disease, has fallen down and pretend that no one saw it, does not catch up a joke, or enjoys collecting playmobil puppets?
minimalism is trending.
it was focus on the idea of reducing all the stuff you have around you, that probably don't contribute you in any profit.
in a technologic and materialistic environment like mine, that idea shocked me.
maybe the tape was exaggerated in the way the lead actor avoided any thing apart from the essential, but the concept is good.
trully, many times we don't need some things that can result in an obstacle for live with intensity the real life, make the most of our face to face relations and to have a healthy habits.
i have rarely use english recently, but i want to apply for a overseas job training of my company.
does anyone help me learn to speak english using skype?
today was a farewell party.
14 people left from my workplace this year.
it is painful for talented people to leave their workplaces.
we will have to do hard instead of them.
i'm looking forward it.
do you know engawa?
each company, including foreign companies, run a booth and exhibited many kinds of robots.
we could receive an explanation of the robots function since the staff had been stationed at the booths.
before i visited it, i thought that robots were more powerful and faster than humans but they could not carry out fine works.
almost all industrial robots had some articulation to assume the various positions, so they could move like as human arms.
in addition, they were ministurized and had sensors which detected contact of humans.
in japan, we have been facing a shrinking population so we need to use robots instead of human.
spread of the collaborative robots would help us with sustained economic growth.
it is one of the usage but i think that humans should be in charge of taking care of customers and robots should do background work.
it's white day today.
i sent a e-mail to my wife's mother for thanks.
i was asked the way to ginza station from two chinese travelers today.
pleases give me a good advice!

in spite of the number of an audience that the auditorium can accommodate, more british theatres don't receive money from the government and so they forced to seek additional sources of financing, arranging except platform performances, foyer music in the entrance foyer, backstage tours, writer's events, outdoor entertainment, tours, etc.
contemporary theatres are experimenting not only with productions but also with theatrical interior.
some of them don't have either fixed staging or fixed seating.
it is possible in particular to remove the seats and transform the room into the hall of impressive scale, where are fan-shaped and the high arrangement of seats or comfortably cushioned benches, allows you to get considerable span of the seats

the pictures show dandelion at the roadside.
i saw some dandelions blooming at the shoulder of a road.
i think that they are very strong and tough because they also endured a cold winter and began to bloom their flowers in spring.

he doesn't like movies much, but we watched the movie "the theory of everything" because he wanted.
although i wasn't so interested in dr.
it became the best movie for me in 2014.
we always love you, dr.
the new apartment is good overall, but the wall splits the next room seems to be very thin.
being one hour head of you means that i'm in the future.
being one hour head of you doesn't mean anything.
being one hour head of you doesn't mean shit.
i wouldn't say anything to him because i know he's full of shit.
we don't need to know about rules when we're learning something, so fuck them.
he's the classic douchebag that nobody stands.
i like coffee and drink too many everyday.
i needed some change.
i'm inclined to have coffee a lot even though my friend suggested me not too have too much.
a beautiful woman in front of me said "oh dear" and was quivering because she just found inspectors on the tram.
i was told at the reception to put on a mask to prevent nosocomial infection.
the e-mail marred everything i planned for saturday.
i can't relate to people who don't have fundamental understanding of human decency.
he lacks decency for everything.
i conducted her skincare since she didn't have good skin condition.
something was pulling me into the marsh in my dream.
i'm not good at catching a glimpse for food what other people are having at the restaurant while deciding what i order.
i don't like all the people scorn other people.
today i was asked.
"what do you think about socialism and communism.
these regimes are cruel and despotic.
tlel me what do you think".
and then i've explained differences between communism and socialism.
first regime is a pipe dream because it is an utopia.
so privet property and people property are combine and you have got both of these property in your country.
if you want to know more write me i will ask your questions.
i haven't regretted that i chose english for learn language.
i felt fabulously interested in the language.
do you hear the sound of waves from the video?

good routine is important for me
it is wednesday morning and have just arrived at the office.
it was my routine to write something down every morning before work when i worked in china, now i want to develop this routine in my office in hong kong.
rewriting notes is very important and it helps me to know what my main focus is and how to have my work done one step by step.
i came here to work in march 1st and it has been 14 days already.
the most important thing for me is to develop some appropriate routines that i am able to live happily in a sustainable way.
we were working hard in an office when the phone rang.
i'm going to germany and poland this autumn for sightseeing.
so, i'm learning german and polish by myself for greetings, for shopping,for asking the way.
german is difficult enough, but, polish is much more than that!!!!!
i can't even distinguish what word they are speaking.
only i can hear is greetings and very few words like "of course.", "that's right.".
but i keep myself up.
today is what they call "white day" in japan.
boys send presents for girls.
my boyfriend will take me to a rich restaurant.
i like smoking a cigarette, but smoking space is very few and narrow.
i don't want to trouble to people around me, so i always go to smoking space if i smoke.
but there is always crowded.
and many cafes and restaurants don't have smoking space.
i really want to more space we can smoke.
our country is making many "non smoking area" for olympic in 2020.
there is nothing for it.
but, maybe they can improve quality of each smoking space.
i hope it.
if i had enough time, i wonder how should i use it.
would i study english more and more or finish my task as much as twice?
i think that time is very precious because i only have a little time, thus i try to make good use of it.
if i had plenty of time, i would never appreciate it any more and start to waste it.
i only have spared time, so i try to make good use of it.
many japanese people don't know slant eyes gesture.
in japan, this gesture is often used as angry gesture.
it looks angry face for us.
i guess many people don't get angry if they meet the gesture.
you can put your index fingers on your forehead.
some kids says "yesterday my mom was like it" while they do the gesture.
motivation to study
i have started thinking about my yet another attempt to approach english a couple of months ago.
i have just little demand in english.
there are a few people in russia that you need to talk to in english in the office eve in international companies.
let's leave aside a wide-spread case of trying to pass entrance exams and getting university education.
let's imagine that you're an ordinary 30 y.
o.
person, who has an average income, who usually has applied, down to earth goals.
why you doing what you doing here?
there is an opinion that spending tax dollars on finding signs of immediate life on other planets is just wastes, others believe that it is a big leap forward for all humankind.
firstly, quite often governments do not have enough money to fulfill some social or economic policies, and subsequently, the level of life in society can slump.
despite these investments can be very useful in the nearest future, for nowadays situation, this is very bad.
secondly, in spite of the fact that people very sure that they will find life on other planets, there is a quite big break that we are alone in the galaxy.
so, if governments did not spend a lot of money on such projects, they would not face a lack of money because they still did not find life on other planets.
firstly, these investments can be justified if they will find something on other planets because other planets have some resources which people can use too.
secondly, the earth is becoming less and less suitable for life because of environmental problems, global warming and so on, and that is why finding other planets is not a crazy option.
some scientists had argued that the earth will explode or die in less than a thousand years, maybe it was one of the main reason why some countries started such projects.
i support the first opinion because such project can be very useful in the future, however, the bulk of the population still do not understand it.
we were sprinting across the meadow, but we caught up only when the bag started being blown from left to right and from right to left, just as the staff sergeant had anticipated.
this zigzagging was to our advantage so that we almost reached the bag.
on the contrary, when the bag got caught by a stone, the staff sergeant used the stick, which he was otherwise constantly swinging through the air, to free the bag so that it could roll on.
of course the staff sergeant immediately got ready to climb down the embankment to fish out the bag with the stick, but i managed to convince him that a bit further down the river we could find a place that was less steep and less slippery.
some people believe that women and men are equal in their rights and should have the same opportunities in such dangerous professions like a soldier or a police officer, while others suppose that there are many differences between genders, and that is why women do not have rights to engage in "male occupations".
on the one hand, men and women are equal in their right and should have the same opportunities.
firstly, a lot of people had thought that men are stronger than women, but with time they were wrong because time has proven that women often are tougher and more stress-resilient, and that is why they can solve problems in such jobs faster.
in other words, it is a stereotype which had been refuted.
for example, men are strong, while women are fast and crafty.
moreover, despite men tend to actions, women quite often think before action.
so, as can be clearly seen from our nowadays world, there are many armies which mainly consist of women because they can operate some task better than men.
finally, this equality in rights is a global trend, and it explains why more and more countries provide access to the army for female.
on the other hand, both women and men have some peculiarities, and this means that for one gender the profession is more suitable than for another.
firstly, women are mothers for their children and they a greater impact on them than fathers, and subsequently, it is better for them to stay home and take care of children.
secondly, if women enlist, it will lead to some problems at the army.
in addition, in some countries, the army is not highly developed, and that is why they can be raped.
thirdly, the simplest argument, but the strongest is that women are just women, they should not be employed in jobs that require physical efforts.
to sum up, despite some people thinking that women must not have an access to army, policy and other structures like these, others argue that both genders should be equal in their rights.
i agree with that latter position because often women can operate some tasks better than men.
moreover, army and police service can give some benefits for women like stability, social security or women just want to express their patriotism through such jobs.
to support my opinion, three reasons are listed as followed.

a man came from a center that deals with senior citizens' home introductions and related matters, who has been engaged in this business more than ten years.
here's some important points regarding a wise choice on a purchase of a senior citizens' home.
they postpone it for many years, but one of the couples may get dementia or another disease that may disqualify them from getting into one.
the building commands a very good view of kobe, one of "a million-dollar view" as it was called before, not only from your room but also from a large bathroom.
after that we visited another senior citizens' home b downtown.
it was about ten-minute walk from a train station.
in home a, you have to pay a lot again to move to a nursing room from your general room in case you're too ill, but in home b you don't have to pay another money.
they seem to be korean.
they wanted to go to arashiyama and asked me whether they can get to there by nara line.
to get to arashiyama, you need to use saganosanin line, so i said to them.
they looked disappointed and said to me thank you, then walked away.
after that, i regret not taking them to the platform for arashiyama.
i'm not good with direction and didn't have confidence.
today, on my way home at kyoto station, two men spoke to me.
they wanted to go to arashiyama and asked me whether they can get to there by nara line.

my selected destinations were spain and portugal, to where i traveled last august, so that means in summer.
at first, i had struggled with my deep-rooted fear of making major decisions, such as taking up this journey, with no prior experience of traveling by myself and such.
from the day one when i sat on that bus seat, i already started feeling different.
and so my trip began: from croatia, through italy, france, spain, and finally portugal, our last destination.
the first day was definitely one of the most tiring ones, because most of our daytime was filled with mere bus travel through italy, where we enjoyed in plentifulness of its fields and hills.
the next day we traveled to arles, an attractive, but scorching hot little town in france, with lots of streets and turns that look alike, and where you might get lost if you don't pay attention, just like i almost did.
it has an amazing hill called montjuic, from where you can see the panorama of the whole city, its harbor, the cool red cable cars, and of course, its splendid sea.
one day of sightseeing couldn't possibly cover this gigantic city, to taste a wide variety of foods it can offer, all the souvenirs you could buy, and all museums and cathedrals you could visit.
and that's why i am thankful that we were there twice.
this was like a world of its own.
after that was granada, where we visited alhambra, a mysterious but pleasant citadel, with lots of flowers, fountains, bushes, and entrances.
this was very likely my second favorite destination on my trip, which i hope will visit again sometimes.
somewhere around the day six, we finally entered portugal, with faro being the first town we visited.
and at last, we came to lisbon.
my only regret about this city is that we spent only around 2-3 hours there, which no way was enough for us to see as much as we wanted to.
the same day we went to fatima where we said our prayers and visited plenty of interesting gift shops, and finally porto, which blew me away with it's steep streets, many cool shops, and breathtaking seaside.
of course, i saw the 'grand' red carpet where many celebrities take pictures, but unfortunately i haven't got any of myself since i had no one close to me there who i might've wanted to take a picture with.
but looking on that whole journey from a different perspective, i realize i took my time really well, got some new insights, found some amazing new places i relished, and that...
this journey was a comfort, as much as an eye-opener that i much needed.

when the tsunami happened, i was in ikebukuro, tokyo with friends.
all of trains were stopped, so we were going to stay in the station.
but it was too cold to stay there, so we went to rikkyo university.

i guess in any languages, there are words that will cause you a big problem if you use it the wrong way.
of corse, there are some in japanese.
by the way, i've lately had a lot of topics i want to talk about.
actually, i was actually going to write about percentage of fault in bike accidents or dog commands, but i'm not up for them today.
this is what i thought, but some english words are confusing and they will cause problems if i use the wrong way.
well, i have to say sorry in advance, because today's post is kind of dirty minded.
if i say, i love cream pie by mistake, i'll be a pervert, right?
of corse, i mean a pastry filled with freash cream, cream puff.
there's another more risky word.
the japanese title is "pocket monster".
recently, i learned it's a nasty word.
in japane, we never associate "pocket monster" with that thing.
when we hear "pocket monster", we picture pocket-sized small creatures.
picachu in a poke ball is pocket-sized, right?
so please don't dislike japanese people saying, "i love playing pocket monster!".
also, i thought the phrase, "have a ball" is a dirty expression until recently.
i find some english words risky to use.
like for example cream puff and cream pie.
well, i have to say sorry in advance, because today's post is kind of dirty minded.
if i say, i love cream pie by mistake, i'll be a pervert, right?

at noon in march 10th when many people were playing and shopping for a weekend relaxing at a commerical center on b street in a city, an amount fires impertuously spreaded out at the sides of the center.
at this time, alarm bells rang loud together with ocurring burnt smell and black smokes, as a result many people hurrily escaped.
the root burning place was the big advertisment table hang at the front side of the center.
the fireman-force of the building and surrounding people removed the fire but no success.
after that, the local police deliverd many specialized cars and tens of oficers to the scene and finally everything was no longer un-burnt
i watched the shape of water last weekend because of the fame and honors it gain in the 90th oscar.
it is a great choice if you want to watch a beautiful love movie in a cozy sunday afternoon.
the retro music and quite, dark tone of the color of the scenes appealed to me a lot.
but to be honest, the best motion picture of the year is an overpraise for it.
i agree that sally hawkins has put a wonderful performance on the screen, but other parameters are just, good - not good enough to defeat its competitive opponents.
by the way, i always love non-human being characters but the so-called god creature in the film doesn't have the non-human characteristics in his personality.
the other thing i am concerned about these days is that i found it very hard to get in a word in my group discussion.
they are all very nice guys, though, i could not follow the rhythm of the conversation.
usually, they just continue on the topic and i end up without saying anything.
it is so frustrating when the same story happens again and again and i am becoming the taciturn person being left out.
especially when they are making jokes or talking in a witty way, i cannot understand a single word though i know they are making fun of something.
unit 2 titled "a day at the beach?" is set in the first term of the course.
i 'm a prevailing reader of english section in our company.

i 'm a prevailing reader of english section in our company.

instead of that i can't go out with a book i borrow.
arrowed only reading in the library.
i need a experience of sales because i am a independent business person.
but i don't have enough skill so i always am curious what other people do for sales.
it's a manga so i could read it very easily.
the author wrote the book from her experience so it was really good book.
my work will end in a day.
if i will have finished my work i want to sleep much at the first.
in addition i will go shopping and buy shoes.
and i will talk with my friends and sleep again.
i have a favor to read books, eat delicious food, listen to music.
i cannot do anything any more.
i had a hard hay fever symptom when i stayed in kyoto two days ago.
probably i think that i didn't have a lot of water as usual on the day.
the person who let others worry about him
there is a person who always tries to let others worry about him.
he may surely something, but i think that his arrogant behavior just degrades himself.
i think that the person who brags about his position has only capacity all that much.
such person is always annoying me and i got mentally exhausted.
also restaurants have so many seats to pack people.
it sit heavy on households.
it sit heavy on households.
social comparison in view of school motivation
there are no significant changes regarding the downward comparison scale in the memory task among low-scorers, by the impact of the recognition of the group data.
on the basis of these results we can say, that if the follower motivational style characterizes someone more likely, that person will rather apply upward comparison and he or she will avoid the strategy of downward comparison.
i explain the results of this study along the basic theories of school motivation and social comparison, and i also take into account the results of some former researches.
there is an attic in my house, which serves as a storage room.
as a boy, i don't like being in the attic because it's gloomy and there are lots of spiderwebs, and what is worse, i could come across rats.
when i reluctantly arrived in the dark room called the attic, i started to search for the book at once, wishing ghosts would not emerge.
unable to get the book easily, my frustration was mounting little by little with time passing.
it was then an old box which was unfamiliar to me entered my vision.
i took it out of the box and put it into my pocket for now.
soon after, the book i was looking for came out, too.
after rushing back to my room, i tried to find out what on earth the paper was, forgetting my first purpose.
he is good at operating a computer soft like word,excel and power point.
he pursues to work efficiently and i think it's one of his advantages.
but i sometimes have my doubts about that.
he try to have other person or department make workpaper he makes now.
someone have to work instead of him.
but i sometimes have my doubts about that.
one day i had a huge yawn and my jaw completely got dislocated.
i rode my motor scooter to the hospital where opened on sunday, with my mouth open widely.
at the time, i was living alone at the apartment away from my home and it was sunday.
one day i had a huge yawn and my jaw completely got dislocated.
the drivers on the another direction stared at my face in wonder, so i was very embarrassed.
in heaven there is no beer!
today, i just finished reading "black house" co-authored by stephen king and peter straub.
it is a sequel to "the talisman" which was also co-authored by them.
in "the talisman", jack sawyer, a 12 years old protagonist, saves his cancer-stricken mother by acquiring "the talisman" flipping into and exploring a parallel world he named "the territories".
several years passes and there appears a serial killer named fisherman in a little town of wisconsin.
"the talisman" was a dark fantasy, but this is the darkest fantasy i ever read, filled with a lot of brutal descriptions.
their exploration from the entrance into the innards of this vast world is narrated in a terse style unlike usual stephen king's style, evoking a more darker version of "alice in wonderland".
there are a few engaging sidekicks and i like the members of thunder five, which is a group of bikers who love harley-davidsons, are intelligent as well as terribly rough.
one of thunder five members, mouse, is bitten by a dog like the baskervilles, poisoned and mutters something interesting in his delirium:
in heaven there is no beer.
that's why we drink it here and when we're gone from here, our friends will be drinking all the beer!
i guessed this is a lyrics of some song, googled and found this:
the best of all, the price is much cheaper than what shows on a popular online shopping site.

you can learn korean tea culture and taste green tea with tea expert watching tea plantation and mt.
in the open forest, you can walk the trail with falling leaves.
here, you can experience natural ecology of jeju.
i returned tokyo station and ate an ice cream.
sort excerpts from the teachings going on in sarnth.
" the enemy can harm you only in this life time bit the negative inflictions have be harming us for countless aeons and are the cause of our being born in the lower realms inflicting inescapable suffering".
" as long as we are not diligent and have consistency in the battle of negative emotions, we can't never be able to get ride of them easily".
i want you not to be a war photojournalist.
second, if you were dead in war zone, your parents, your friend and so on would be sad.
in conclusion, i want you to be other profession.
question: what's the difference between "from then on" and "since then"?
same?
i don't eat chicken after that.
i want to go taiwan someday.
my friends have visited there but i haven't yet.
there are many delicious foods and cultural building.
first of all, i think that people personal connection is getting weaker and weaker.
for example, 50years ago, my grandfather told me that everybody took care and they knew each other with their neighbors.
when the neighbor got sick, he made tomato soup and sending flowers.
however, i live in small town but, i don't know about next neighbors and i never talked with them since i moved this place.
as this example demonstrates, i think that people personal connection is getting weaker and weaker.
it that i had a civil service examination was just a year ago.
it's a kind of turnabout to me.
on the other hand, i am confident that people life is getting more convenient year after year thanks to the online shopping.
for instance, 50years ago, the bookstore and the shopping mole located in the downtown area.
therefore, if you want to buy new items, such as new clothes or the new book, you had to go there, according to my grandparent's story.
by contrast, nowadays, you can use the online shopping service.
this is very convenient for everybody because we bought new items through the online shopping.
we don't have to go out and another great thing about the online shopping is that you can specify delivery time by yourself.
as a result, you are able to spend more time at home and families.
as this example illustrates, i am confident that people life is getting more convenient year after year thanks to the online shopping.
i'm very easy to get nervous in the situations, and my mind is always blank, so i need some preparations.
what i'm interested the most is sumo, because i work at a sumo arena only when the tournament takes place in tokyo.
my assignments are showing seats or giving basic information to foreign guests, because every sign in the venue is written in japanese.
apart from that, i should help with them when they are in troubles, like losing their belongings.
sometimes young guests don't follow the rule or some tourists try to enter the arena with fake tickets.
when i face an unexpedted situation, i think my english would improve.
i feel fulfilled when the guests say gratitude to me.
i'm very easy to get nervous in the situations, and my mind is always blank, so i need some preparations.
what i'm interested the most is sumo, because i work at a sumo arena only when the tournament takes place in tokyo.
i'm in the information desk.

when i face an unexpedted situation, i think my english would improve.
i'm required to have flexibility and attentiveness.
i feel fulfilled when the guests say gratitude to me.
moreover, i also think that you are able to get about global information by internet.
for example, 50 years ago, only a few people used the internet service.
when i asked my grandfather about how you obtained american news while you lived in japan.
he told me that only downtown bookshop was dealing with american newspaper.
unfortunately, most information was too behind the week.
however, nowadays, i am able to read american newspaper while i live in japan by the internet.
most american newspapers cost are free to read.
for this reason, if i want new item when not sell in japan, i am able to get a new item.
as this example shows, i also think that you are able to get about global information by internet.
i went to kuala lumpur for the first time in the two months.
this is 10th times i go to kl.
i want to live in kl in the future because the foods are good and the commodity prices are low.
my name is naomi and i'm a japanese teacher in preply.
in my lesson, you can learn japanese through talking about some topics,reading articles and using materials.
when i was a university student, i had been to australia for 5 weeks for studying abroad.
that's why i can speak english as you know.
i was working as a systengineer unti december 2017.
after that i started teaching japanese, so i'm really beginner japanese teacher, but i'd love to teach you japanese.
i know learning language is not easy, but it's definitely spread your life.
let's challenge with me.
how does turkish sound to you.
turkish sounds nice and pleasant to me.
as others said, it is an agglutinative language and has a harmony or rhythm on its words.
it seems that the singing style has also been influenced by other middle eastern languages including persian, and this makes it again more familiar to my ears.
i'm a fan of the folklore and classical music and singing style of persian and the middle east in general.
these days i fell in love with the following song and has listened to it for many times:
is it really a good thing speaking english to my kids every time?
it's quite challenging for me, but anyway i did it.
when i heard this, i didn't fully understand enough to explain what the bitcoin was.
even now, i don't think i have enough knowledge about it, so recent news about cryptocurrency makes me feel more dangerous and scary.
investing in bitcoin sounds like a gamble for me.
it might be okay when you have extra money to buy, but still it doesn't look stable and safe.
even the technology is advanced, and crypto-currency becomes more stable, i don't think the day will come when cryptocurrencies will replace real cash.
i don't think people will give up using the joy of physical money, at least it is absolutely true for me.
well, i was planning to read books yesterday 8.
it cost me half an hour as time go on.
i start to hate it!
but it's really funny.
then i fell nervious, i opened the steam and play civlization 6 for 1.5 hours, but did nothing there.
at last, the laptop getting hot, i closed the game.
luckily, i watched a documentary named the world at war, an amazing!

i myself borrowed many copies of his works from a school library those days.
edogawa ranpo was a japanese mystery writer who wrote mainly between the 1920s and 1950s.
most of his works were for adults and had old style of writing with scads of grotesque descriptions.
however, some of them were written for kids and even now they are popular among elementary school children.
ranpo loved the works of western mastery writers of the time and his pseudonym "edogawa" had been borrowed from edgar allan poe, his most loved author.

ranpo loved the works of western mastery writers of the time and his pseudonym "edogawa" had been borrowed from edgar allan poe, his most loved author.
a lot of people believed the reason was because she had changed her political line with the pro-american forces.
when i did that, i was like "what the hell i have done!
i spoiled it!!" it was too late to regret what i did, so i'm going to write about the movie that i watched on last week.
i wrote about it in previous article, but i just want to write it again as i'm big fun of it.
i have not known her until i watched the movie.
i'm sure the song made her well-known in the world.
first time i listened her song, i was resonated.
i think her song is kind of an anthem to those on the fringes of society who feel actually like hopeless in their life.
i also watched her performance in you tube.
the sun rise time is earlier and sunset time is later than winter season.
neighbor gave me a lot of horsetails last week.

he and i used to do the same part-time-job at a bar over a decade ago in tokyo.
since we were in about the same age, we discussed various things which included favorite soccer players, favorite musicians and so on.
we also used to went for drinks after work.
the memories make me feel nostalgic.
thanks to my custom which i write some english journal everyday, i thought that i could write the message naturally.
i replied the message in english, promising that we meet up when he comes to japan next time.
the only thing i saw before me were the devouring fire and my book...
my body moved by itself and was about to insert my arms into the fire as i felt my feet gradually leaving the ground.
i also felt a tight itch around my neck's back.
the air around me started filling with furious shouting, rain splatter and rattle.
the world's colors and shapes started fading back in, and so did the weight on my shoulder and my father's furious eyes.
the agony i had been feeling before left my body as horror took it's place.
"what did i tell you about staying in your room, oriel?!" he shouted, as he spattered my face with warm saliva.
he kept applying more and more strength into his grasp with each syllable he pronounced.
your friend: "i want to be a war photo jounalist in the future."
i have two reasons for it.
first, a war photojournalist is very dangerous.
i think you cannot live longer than others.

a doctor is safer than a photojournalist.
being a photojournalist will give you a lot of risk in a war zone.
however a doctor is a difficult job to become.
i hope that you will find a good job and get your happy life.

my first preference is about vegetarian food.
my first preference is about vegetarian food.
in addition to that i like to say about joint family and respect towards each other.
my examples and reasons will explain below which will strengthen my point of view.
to begin with, people from other countries should adopt food tradition from my country.
so there is very less chances of obesity and heart diseases.

most of the people in the world have reason of death due to obesity.
being vegetarian, helpful for person to build a good health and maintain our body.
it not only limited to family but also society.
due to respect towards each other bond between the two people make stronger and help them to build good relationship.
try to observe their parents behavior and try to behave like them.
if parents behave respectfully with every one and respect others point of view which will be helpful for children.
due to this custom, it built a good society.
in addition to, joint family is another custom should adopt other countries.
in my country, many people stay in joint family.
celebrate festivals and any other function together.
children are very happy while talking with their grandpa and granny.
before sleeping they listen different spiritual stories from granny, which help them in future and make good attitude towards life.

in some situations, i do assignments with my friends because sometimes studying in a group is more useful than studying alone.
for example, when i was a university student, i studied economics.
at first, we split and allocated our assignments and materials, like textbooks and case books, to each individual, and we read those materials at home.
in a study group meeting, we explained what we learned by studying by themselves to others, and if others asked questions they came up with, we tried to answer them.
if it was hard for me to explain something to others, it meant that i got a clue to identify where i did not understand.
in this way, i found out easily what i had to focus on, studying in a group.

short conclusion, any grammar mistake?
though wendy alexander anchors her argument in a universal context, her political affiliation is clearly reflected in her argument.
this is demonstrated by the fact that she appeals to scottishness in a scottish nationalist newspaper.
the rhetoric of the argument is quite interesting, as the author starts by mentioning her own children in order to appeal to scottish people feeling of nationhood, in order to make them consider the importance of the union, in order to solve the universal stakes.
her argument is indirectly aimed at inviting scottish people to vote for the scottish labour party to the third scottish parliament election of may.
wendy alexander's argument relies on the promise that the labour party would make scotland rise among other countries, in order to solve what the author identifies as universal stakes, namely globalisation, poverty and climate change.
as a conclusion to her article, wendy alexander specifies that scottish independence would be a waste of time and energy, and that the union is necessary to help scotland rise among other nations and bloom economically speaking.
a few months later, on the third of may 2007, a major change took place in scottish politically history, as for the first time since 1995, the labour party did not come first in scotland.
it reflects a change in scottish mindsets...

the purpose of this report is to evaluate a new mobile device called bmb, a new generation of mobile devices.
according to a recent survey, this report will summarize the pros and cons of the new products and it will conclude with recommendations for improvements.
by and large,  the market price of the bmb devices seems to be a little more expensive than their other competitors does, more advanced features and higher quality is expected by the average user.
there are several competitors that have really good products in the market behind the bmb mobile.
another weak point is the screen, a better definition of colors is expected.
the screen provider, nt tech is launching a new version of the screen so it would be reasonable that bmb incorporates the latest features shortly.
even it is said by the survey the battery life, wap service and voice recorder are considered as satisfactory, a product of this range of prices could not fail in such critical areas.
this kind of products are deeply examined by tech gurus in specialized magazines and internet forums, and this factor will be determinant when you are getting information on the internet in order to purchase a mobile.
digital camera and text messages seem to be the top features of bmb.
in order to become more competitive and attractive to the public, bmb should focus on provided with better components their bmb product, changing their screen, lengthier the life expectancy of the battery in order to maintain their sales price.
i would strongly recommend them to appear in well-known magazines and tech blogs with the new version of the device come to the stores.
finally, i consider if the price is fair, bearing in mind all the new products of the competency and take action according to that.

he made such a decision after two months of long negotiations with the other pro-independence parties in parliament.
on friday, puigdemont said that it would not be a drama if a new election has to be held over the next few months, arguing that if the pro-independence political parties were not able to comply with the mandate of their voters then it was better to give them the word again through a new election.

keira's first impulse was to strech out her claws and tear his throat, but seh managed to control it long enough to think.
if she kill him, someone would find the body soon, and that would mean another punishment for her.
but if he had said the truth she'd lost her only chance to escape.
getting exasperated she quickly assess all the pros and cons.
finally she clos her eyes, making her decision.
relieved liam didn't hestiate to began moving.
keira listened carefully for liam's slow movements, trying not to growl as his cold fingers grazed the skin ofher left ankle.
however, a menacing hiss left her lips when the shackle squeezed lightly on her foot, increading the burning of her cut.
suspicious she opened her eyes just in time to see a black hexagon spreading out along the entire chain, every few seconds liam touched one of the golden points and made sure that keira's skin wasn't touching the anlyzer.
the chain grated slighty seconds before that the anlyzer returned to its original form after having turned the metal into a thin glass.
curious keira watch how bit by bit her leash began to crack and finally exploded in a thin layer of white dust.

if one man cries it is the sweat of his heart sprouting from his eyes.
early roses are very fragile.

yesterday, i had drunk with friend in a bar.
i am not good at drinking.
i was always afraid of getting drunk.
yesterday,i had some drinks with friend in a bar.
friend told me that it helps relax our tense.
i was afraid that i might puke, but finally i got over with that terrible feeling.
i don't like the word tough girl, because whenever i hear it, a image of a muscle woman would appear in my head.
but those girls are very easy to get along well with, their inside match their outside, so you don't have to guess what she is really thinking
beautiful girls all have high standards of choosing boyfriends or even friends.
why are they so picky.
on the other hand liam frowned when he saw keira's wound.
it was deep enough to leave a scar and, because of its lack of bleed he could see the multiple withe scarse around her injury.
"finish, alredy!" she growled with annoyance.
liam roll his eyes, placed the anlyzer on the chain around her other ankle and did again the same process.

one of my friends' asked me told me that one of her friends has been living in shanghai for a couple of months and one of her friends has never paid money for drinks since she started living there, the reason why she's face looks as if babies doll which means typical westerner's face.
japanese people standards of beauty are always westerner's face or looking.
why people always don't think about oriental eyes are good?
in my opinion, people don't have confidence in themselves.
it's also japanese media built up what is the standard of beauty for women.
i have a lot of complects on my face but is that something wrong?
and people can't become completely westerner's face.
i don't say, people shouldn't wear makeup but people shouldn't have one opinion of beauty in perspective.
we should more think about bring out the best in everyone and they have more confidence in yourself, i understand it is hard to do it but if people have self-confidence or don't worry about what other people think, they'll enjoy more them life.

i want to go to my sister and stay at her house at the weekend.
today, i called my mother to ask her to take care of our dog while we go on a trip.
she might have looked for a part time job, though she is still a career woman.

but i also want you to remember that time, your dream is wonderful.

the persistence of gun-related murders despite the country's restrictive laws on possession of firearms leads some to question the efficiency of said laws.
others go as far as to suggest the legalization of the possession of firearms as a solution, as it would supposedly allow citizens to defend themselves against threats and make criminals more insecure about their success.
however, given the examples that there are across the globe, which work both in favor and against such suggestion, it is clear that the issue is not as black-and-white as many imagine it to be.
i then sneaked back to the first stairstep, worried about my backpack's rocking with each step.
i crouched and started stepping down the stairs, without taking my eyes off the shadow.
my heart skipped a bit when i saw it crouching and standing up after a few seconds.
i heard a subtle snapping and popping echo grow louder the closer i would get to the entrance door.
i followed the footsteps with my eyes, and noticed a dim orange light emanating from the dining-room.
i slightly leaned to the left, just enough to peak from far away, and saw a familiar robust man with a bare back, facing the fireplace while holding a long fire iron in his right hand.
and then, all of sudden, i saw him stand up, sight and stretch both of his hands.
my body trembled and that translated into an unsteady step, and a lose in balance.
i fell sideways, and obviously, my backpack did as well, making the loudest noise ever that night.

how we understand that this movie is good and another is not at all?
sometimes the main idea can be sayed by the film characters.
for example, the main idea of the film "three billboards outside ebbing" that hatred breeds hatred was sayed by young foolish girlfriend of mildred's ex-husband.
the truth by the mouth of a foolish, oh, how ironic!
does this movie original or you've already watched many movies of these kind of things?
for example, the originality of the movie "dogville" by lars von trier is the minimum of decoration.
despite the abscence of decorations this movie is interesting and so exciting.
a good movie contains cultural code, references to others pieces of art.
it seems multilayered which makes a cult film.
you can read film criticism articles, reviews or top lists, but do it after the watching of the movie, because your opinion shouldn't be preconceived.

throughout our conversation, i have grasped that investment banking played the pivotal role to raise funds and ensure a smooth operation of his business.
yet, i gave up for once since i was afraid of losing this very high competition.
for 90 seconds, i conveyed my thought about how trying my best would lead me to the best outcome based on my experience to get into this school.
throughout my career exploration from corporate fp&a to corporate finance, nothing more than the investment banking industry excites, challenges and makes me be a better version of myself.
i have been fascinated to see how much i progressed since last year and see my further personal growth among dedicated and committed peers.

researching and knowing about other planets are important for us, but living there is a not good idea.
first, it costs too much to live apart from earth.
we need to board a space ship when moving.
that requires much energy and money.
also, when we communicate with people who remain on earth, or buy something that we can't get in the planet we live in, we have to pay too much money.
we can't even breathe in other planets so masks and suits are essential.
also, there might be harmful substances or creatures we've never knew.

in general, people don't come to watch a theater alone in japan, some people might think that i'm kind of wired people.

the day, march 11, became special not only for me but also all japanese.

maybe the special days for japanese are few.
the other days are august 15 in 1945, when we japanese lost in second world war, august 6 and 9, when atomic bombs fell in japan.
when i was only a child, second world war was already an old story, though not so many years passed yet.
we were hardly able to find foreign tourists then.
i spent a really happy time yesterday.
my wife bought me new jogging shoes and socks at a sporting goods store in a shopping moll near kyoto station.

i consulted with a staff about the result and we selected the best one for my legs.

we gave up buying the one and decided to buy on internet.

i am still confused why donald trump, a liar and a pervert, had been elected as president of the united states.
in my eyes, christians value things like moral,self-discipline and so on, which is quite obviously unrelated to that man.

it didn't go unnoticed to keira the tension that her words generated in liam, and not for the first time she wondered the reasons behind his presence ther.
she would do almost anything to get out of there, but time had taught her that actions have consecuences.
however, a spark of hop stired up in her heart.
she can feel it the same way her animal instincts always feel the danger.
but also she sense that it was something more.
her wild part couldn't completely understood it, and she really didn't want to explore the reason.
as if he sense her inner doubt, liam closed the distance between them.
he put himself within her hand's reach and stood there challenging her with his eyes.

these days, there is a hidden impulsion in my chest that urges me shout out: stand up girls!
perhaps it has a close relationship with the past women's day.
in many social networking websites, people discussed about the topic of feminist and gender equality.
the concerned phenomenon i want to mention is that many people deliberately avoid the word "fu nv" in chinese, which means "women".
you can see many alternatives of "women's day" such as "queen festival" and "goddess festival", which reflects people's reluctance to "fu nv".
in dictionaries, "fu nv" is defined as adult women, but in ancient chinese, this word often refers to married women.
it seems absurd to deem the word "women" or "married women" as something with a derogative sense, but it is exactly the fact, at least here in china.
as a result, businessmen are willing to provide special discounts on this "queen festival" so that a large number of young ladies are attracted to purchase clothes and cosmetics to keep their beauty.
but date back to the origin of women's day, this day is never established to serve the businessmen to earn money.
the working and living environment is still severe to women, despite years' effort of all the brilliant women workers.
the negative stereotype is rather strong and even girls themselves have accepted the bias on them.
it's cheaper than asking price.
i met my nice friend and go to see a live with her.

i breathed twice, and stepped on the ground, away from the cold window and the warm sheets.
i headed towards my room's bookshelf and finally, a small backpack.
i picked it up and nearly losed my balance because of how much it weighted.
i swung it to the left right before hearing the things it helt crinckle.
i then inserted my left hand in it, and then my right one.
next, i walked toward the door and gently placed my left ear on it.
i felt it's harsh finishing, and focused on the opposite side.

there are spams accounts mailing everyone with viral content.
usually, in this type of attack viruses are hidden as an attachment in the mail or as a link.
but one thing is sure, they want to install a trojan virus in the computer.
in this way, criminals can spy and sniff your movements on the net, your personal data including files, programs and pictures recorded on your hard disk.
as a new regulatory law arise due to control money movements, it is harder to spend money on the net or transferring from one bank to another using false identities.
after that, they forced you to pay them in order to unencrypting those files.
security in the internet
in my humble opinion internet is safe.
activities like buying by the internet, transferring money or surfing on the net, should not be a risk in normal circunstances.
for example, i remember one time i bought a huge television with an incredible price in a low reliable shop.
i went to the police to put a denounce.
i will never forget its "caja de andorra".
only three days later they put my money back.

older persons can teach teenagers about the experiences and challenges that had faces in their lives, what they have learned from all the years that they lived, how the person can save his time and spend it in a good things.
on the other hand, there are a lot of experiences that young persons can teach to old persons like; using the internet, smart phones, laptops and a lot of things that spread via the technology in this world.
young people can teach the elder how the time has changed, how we must manage ourselves to live with different people from various cultures, attitudes, learning levels, and different thinking about major things like love, living alone, working in the night, etc.
concluding, we need each other, we learn from children, teenagers, adults, and old people.
we learn from sellers, doctors, teachers, engineers, drives, etc.

so, when parents get old, they may lost their ability to live by their own and need caring almost anytime.
it's unrealistic that we could stay around them every day, so sending them to nursing home would be a good choice
besides, when parents get old, they could get very illed, it's necessary for them to be available to professional care.
i think nursing homes are equipped with medical equipment and professional doctors

last thursday, i changed my old phone into a new iphone x.
it is the model change for the first time in seven years.
in addition to those, i had to charge twice a day because my phone's battery had degraded with age.
i knew it was time to change it into new one, but i had been delaying change.
i am planning to shoot various photos and videos of my hometown when i go home next week, so i decided to buy a new phone this time at last.
i think only a few people keep using the same smartphone for seven years.

you take good care of things", but the truth is that i am just lazy.
it seems annoying for me to adjust a lot of phone's settings to suit my needs.
even now i am getting tired with them.
i need to refresh my english, would you be so kind to help me?
thanks, dominic

in my opinion, online courses are as effective as traditional casses.
since smart phones and tablets were released, the number of users has been increasing around the world.
to use these appliances, speed of internet has been getting faster.
so, unless students go to class rooms, they can listen and look the courses by their own smart phones and tablets anywhere.
these appliances make it easier to learn even if there are many distances between students and teachers.
they can save money and time to go to class rooms.
i think that thanks to technical progresses, online courses are sufficiently effective these days.

on the other hand, more than 80% of the electronic information stored around the planet is in english and two thirds of the earth's scientists read in that language.
in addition, english is present in the cultural, social, political and economic life of the most of the countries of the world.
english is the tool that allows communication with people from other countries, within the globalized world in which we live.
it can also be considered that english is not a difficult language to learn compared to others, english grammar has a logical and much simplified sequence to the grammar to which we are accustomed.
for all these reasons, i consider that english is essential, and even more in the field of education, since it allows us to access information and be in contact with the rest of the world.
it is unthinkable today to train in this globalized world without knowledge of english.

the renal shops
i usually go to the rental shop which offers many cds and dvds at reasonable price,
but going to that shop is only when i need to rent some dvds for my daughter.
when i want to watch the move for me,i'm tend to download from the online shop.
so i rent the dvds from the rental shop when i rent at first time.
but it used for many people and there are many the rental shops.
to use the rental shop is relatively troublesome for tourists, because the user have to register for the membership.
if in case of living japan.
the rental shops is useful for many people,
because in general the shops offers more reasonable price than the online shop.
she was arrested for sitting in the withes-only section of the cinema.
how many people was involved in the issue?
from the first moron that raised a complain, to the cops that arrested her, the fiscal that lead the prosecution, the judge that had to hear the case...
she was the protagonist of an incident to challenge segregation in canada ten years before the famous case of rosa park.

in recent years with the booming of the economy, university is no longer as a luxury thing for the general, so most people decide to attend in the college not only because of the piece of paper of diploma but also for the quality of education.
under this view, some people claim that only one way to improve the quality of education is universities which should spend more money on salaries for the university professors.
as far as i a concerned, this statement is too arbitrary and unilateral, because wages increased for the professors do not directly represent that the quality of education will be improved.
i'm now on the voyage to kyushu, where i was born and brought up.
i think driving a car for yourself on the comfortable road with your favourite songs is like a meditation, because i often feel like both my car and body are mixed and harmonized together.
only unlucky guys are caught sight of and assigned some fines by the police as human sacrifices.
in this sense, driving on the highway can be compared to an adventure of the dungeon full of killer monsters.

pinkey's age of reason and decision making would be frozen in place.
this halting of her growth and development was as if the sun itself, having ever so slightly peeked over the horizon to spread its radiance into the thick, wild darkness of the land, was suddenly imprisoned in the sky before it could ascend any higher so that only a tiny fragment of its light could pierce through the shadow that was imprisoning the land.
an obsession controlled my mind, and i wondered why i was so caged by society and unable to live according to my own reasons and decisions.
however, pinkey had now reached grade 8, which meant that our elders would soon halt her formal education.

to the contrary, they were even more traditional and narrow-minded, and their limited view that could only imagine so much was swiftly becoming a chain wrapped around our legs chaining us to a tiny, little destiny.
pinkey was forced to stop going to school as i was.
she willingly accepted the cage of prevailing belief that girls over age 14 were supposed to stay at home and help with household chores.
my fiery indignation at such traditions and beliefs still simmered, and as if it had its own life, it refused to die down, to diminish.
every day i thought about my education and the restrictions on my life.
an obsession controlled my mind, and i wondered why i was so caged by society and unable to live according to my own reasons and decisions.
i became silent as he talked about my education.
for example, i have decided that i will do my intermediate studies in commerce, not in medicine or engineering.
how dared he say such a thing!
i felt embarrassed and quickly took the soap out of water, and closed the tap.

i guess she catches words that she knows or she thinks important and understand the contents.
a few days ago, a lang-8 wrote that we need to practice english for one million hours to become as fluent as native english speakers.
do you think if we need such many hours?
once you understand what others are saying, you would communicate with people much better.
as you know, you have to take two tests to pass the level, a paper test and an interview.
the paper test includes the listening section; my granddaughter seems very good at listening.
that's why she got almost perfect on the listening section.
she passed the paper test at the last eiken test, but she failed the interview test.
this time, she didn't have to take the paper test.
i suppose she practiced a lot for the interview, so she believed she passed the test before she got the result.
she doesn't use english every day.
i guess she catches words that she knows or she thinks important and understand the contents.
i think this is the way that we should listen to english.
when i talk with my friends, my brain catches only certain important words.
even though i don't hear all of their words clearly, i understand what they are talking about.
that's why i immediately reply to their words.
a few days ago, a lang-8 wrote that we need to practice english for one million hours to become as fluent as native english speakers.
i joked back to him, "we can't live such a long time," and then, he replied that he should have said "10,000 hours."

i will show you a thing which is currently popular in japan.
there are several shops in tokyo where you can experience smashing roof tiles, which is just like karate practice.
you don't have to worry about your hand being injured.
that's why there is a slit in the middle beforehand, and you can relatively easily break them.

kawarawari looks very attractive to me.
my boyfriend who was off first said he was going to use car-sharing service, so we ride it together.
when we were heading, i saw a lot of people waiting for a bus so i was so lucky he picked me up for me!
i cooked a salad just now.
seasonings are vinegar, olive oil, sea salt, cumin, and basil.
i cook everyday.
now, i improved my cooking skill.
nextly, i have to develop my time managing skill.
anyway, you can get on even shinkansen with ic card here in japan.
you can use this deposit card even a vending machine, convenience store or so.
i saw this ic card in hong kong, called octopus and according to bonyari, in the uk there is either.
your world is oyster some thing like that...
do you have this kind of card where you are?
there is a saying, "seasons come, and seasons go," which originally meant that the winter cold lasts until the spring equinox day, while the summer lasts until the autumn equinox day.
now it has come to mean,"time will solve your problems."
however, it is enough to warm these days, now i will take off.
i would be grateful if there are any unnatural expression in the following:
i don't mind if you do that later.
it doesn't matter when you do that.
if your busy now, it can wait till later.
it can be done when your finished.
there's no hurry - in your own time!
our sales in a current term is not as good as the last tarm.
we have to be really serious about that.
my direct boss got a little emotional and made us think how to make our sales better.
we are aiming to surpass the last sales, but we can't carry it out as the current tarm is only left a few weeks.
"we' have to do something for the next tarm to get a more seles.",my boss gave us a pep talk.
having said that, our clients budgets will be lessened in the next tarm, so we'll face the difficulty making more sales.
one of the solutions that i mentioned was to focus on getting a new client by making a cold-calling to many companies.
some of coworkers were against my idea because we currently lack of stuffs.
we didn't come to conclusion in the meeting.
i still think the cold- calling is one of the best solutions.
when people touch the sensor on the trunk, lights with correspond symbols will flicker.
the interactive way is too direct, such as pressing the button then the light will be turned on.
people cannot reflect anything through the interactive process.
we got inspiration from the alchemy.
we chose the symbol of philosophers stone which is a mystical substance that can turn basic metal into gold.
when people move their hands they will find the light change and have different effects
then, we made a plastic model at csm, however, the largest radius the machine can make is about 15 cm...
so, 50 cm radius is impossible...
and if we change the meteral into glass, it will be too expensive...
also, this 3d sculpt is too direct, not so much design elements in it - too similar with the original alchemy symbol.
since a long time ago, japanese school english teachers have been criticized for their own english skills.
they may have some problems but when it comes to learning, i believe that all responsibility in learning lies on the learners themselves after all
the reason why japanese students do not improve their english skills is that they do not prepare fields where they use english on their own.
forgetting their own laziness, they start to blame their schools, the quality of their class, and their teachers.
but wait and think for a while.
so many boogers keeping making complaints are not aware of their foolishness.
if you keep wasting your time using the method in fashion, you should have your students learn by more practical words, phrases, and grammar.
only school teachers are satisfied with using different ways from the classical method and they feel happy with their evaluations that they obtain because they use a method in fashion.
even after reflecting on grammar translation method, in which the teacher translates each sentence in the language of his students, the method is still used for teaching in present days.
i want them to teach in a stress-free style.
to improve your english skills effectively, you need to absorb a numerous number of knowledge and information.
depending on how much knowledge the learners have and how many chances to use it they have, they will enhance their english skills.
japanese english learners must know a lot of english words and learn even old-fashioned grammar before they pass their university entrance exams.
they only input.
they have no chances to output what they absorbed.
they should have a lot of chances in which they make errors and are corrected so that they can use it better.
back to the first topic, are japanese english teachers really poor in their own english skills?
that will be more helpful when you become english teachers in japan.
the sience makes it possilbe to improve the standard of our life.
i'm considering to buy a new one.
one of the very boston-specific stuff is the boston accent.
car talk guys have really heavy boston accents.
i don't really see a person from ma.
then one random person talked to me with heavy boston accent, "cute huh?
he belong to this cafe and loves human." it was a pretty heavy accent, so i had to ask my significant other to translate to me without the boston accent.
boston native speak not only with specific accent, but also they speak very fast.
that makes me even hard to understand it.
i don't know there will be a day i can follow the boston accent.
once a week, we often roam in the book store or go to try some food in a new eatery that we have just found out.
my friend also get me into playing volleyball.
we play togerther on every thursday afternoon in the park near my house.
i assume playing sport is good way to release energy and it's funny too.
you get a point by rewriting someones post.
your post will be appeared on top of the feed depending on how many points you have.
visitors came from parent company yesterday.
first of all, i should say about my story of islam.
honestly, my first impression about islam is not good.
i thought islam is so annoying religion.
how many rules it is!
but i had an opportunity to give a presence.
i choiced the theme of islam.
i didnt have a clearly reason.
and i learned islam is a little funny.
however it happened 9.11 and islamic state.
i didnt go to islamic countries as many people for a long time.
both countrys people very welcomed me.
i guess egyptian who live in japan is tired.
of course, one of their is bad.
however i enjoyed it at last.
thanks for giving me a great trip, awesome islam.
i am a japanese and i study english everyday.
sometimes i think that line reply is troublesome.
the input by hand is boring.

i want to know how to do well those thing.

the house we can see its roof from here was built 5 years ago.
my friend talked about a boy who didn't go to school and only stays at home.
as far as she heard and shared with me, the boy didn't get a diploma from a junior high school, so his family lost hope to his future.
before entering a senior high school, you need a diploma of a junior high school.
as long as they are registered as a resident, they receive the request which tells that they are expected to attend the nearest public junior high school.
my friend told me that the boy didn't have a diploma of a junior high school.
in such a case too, they can get the document to give a senior high school by the enrollment.
if they ask the junior high school which they were registered, the school give the document, but just with the fact: zero attendance, the lowest grade to all subjects.
i am just afraid of a case that the boy was omitted from the list.
if only they had once attended a school in japan before they turned 16, even for a month, they could have gotten the certificate.
it is an authorised examination to give those people the certificate to entry an entrance exam for a senior high school.
jlpt n1 passers are recognised to have as good japanese proficiency as a graduate of a junior high school.
almost every day, i get phone calls from people who want to know what to do to get a diploma from a senior high school.
this system is applied to all the residents, including children who don't have japanese nationality.
in such a case too, they can get the document to give a senior high school by the enrollment.
some of my former students in the philippines suffered the problem.

in japan,we will take a job after graduated high school or college.
japanese say "this is common."
i think so,but i try various experiences.
now i am a college student. so,i have a time.
during college student,i think about "finding employment" or "starting business" or others.
for the long time in a year
i posted lang8 for the first time in a year.
i was busy my private.
i kept study english other ways.
it is hard to get use to study english...
i think japanese people do not like self confidence people especially in our generation.
japanese people prefer moderate and humble personality, so we are expected humble comments even though they are the olympic winners or succeeded persons.
if people from western countries have confidence, it is ok because we easily accept the fact that they are different from us.

i remembered sometimes azeem and i used to race at the bank of the river indus when father used to take us out.
i had never felt that happy since i was grounded.
the cold, wet sand on the bank was like dew on the grass.
i thought that he became positive person than before.
he was surprised that a new shopping center will be built in this countryside even though i told him before.
the most shocking thing was the train that they were 1 or 2 train cars.
he said that, "my hometown is a remote village, right?"
i was laughed it because he said such a thing even though it was common for him for a long time.
i wanted to spend more time with him, but he came back to tokyo yesterday.
could you correct my self-presentation? i wrote this text for self-presntation video.
and i'm from a small town in russia, which name you probably don't know.
so let's just move to my educational background.
last summer i finished the udmurt state university and got bachelor's degree in linguistics.
while studying at the university in order to improve my english skills, i took part in the camp america program.
i spent three months in a summer camp and it was such an amazing experience, so it turned me to be a teacher.
though, my real major in the university was practice and theory of translation.
as for my hobbies, it is singing and translating movies or tv series.
but i think it is good rather than bad.
i'm currently living and working in thailand, but i'd like to get back not only to work that corresponds to my qualifications, but also to that i enjoy doing.
i'd really love to work with kids in china and teach them english.
so i think that is all i wanted to tell about myself for now and i hope to see you soon in china.
a wolf robot keeping security at rice fields in japan
hokkaido wolfs are used to existed in japan but were exticted by a wolf eliminating campaign at the beginning of 19th century.

a couple of days ago, i corrected an entry.
a native english speaker corrected some of them the same as me, and then, he said "thank you."
i can't recall the exact sentence, but it's like the following.
i've never used "the present perfect clause" with "when" when i refer to the future.
i started to wonder whether the present perfect tense work well with all the conjunctions, when, after, before, and until when you refer to the future.

"well, mari sits in the middle of this row, as today is her day, right?"
"then, ken, take a seat to mari's right."
"and, kana, sit that row, facing mari's row, in front of her."
"and you, saori is diagonally left in front mari."
there are two rows of 3 seats facing each other across the table.
"then, ken, take a seat to mari's right."
how hard it is?
i'm worried about studying abroad from september because of such my character...
robots also can help seniors who live alone feel less isolated by being companions for them.
when i talk with people who only try to sticks to rule, i would like to tell them that i want to talk about the way how to solve the problem we are facing to now.
i think that rule exists in order to protect people.
i know we should follow rules, but if the rules only restrict our action, i think that these are just useless.

i have started to running like 3 months ago.
at the start, was so hard for us because the body wasn't prepaired yet.
i ran like 500 meters and i felt very tired, with no air in the lungs and my legs pain.
now, we run around 5 kilometer per day, we're used to run every other day.
in my case, the running helped me a lot.
before start to running i got tired really fast doing anything.
now i'm feeling better, i felt the difference, i felt the advantages related to the sport practice.
however, in the 19th century of japan, katakana weren't used as much as nowadays.
therefore, they expressed the name of foreign countries by kanji characters back then.

the question about tolstoy and dostoevsky party is a way to determine which life view is more closer for you.
also if you want to know more about somebody it is a good way to ask this question.
these two giant russian classic writers have such polararizing life view.
that's why they are always opposited to each others.
he didn't explore the depths of the soul of his characters as dostoevsky, but he focused on the finding of the life meaning, faith and ethic.
tolstoy was interested in the question about god and he thought that a particle of god is in everyman.
however, dostoevsky is a great psychologist and he focused on the edges of human nature.
dostoevsky, also as tolstoy, was interested in the finding of god.
his characters discovered god through the suffering, being on the edge of a nervous breakdown, hysteria or madness.
i think that i'm tolstoy party, because i find him more hearted and humane.

also, during 7 days including each equinox day, japanese people a visit to a grave.
many other curiosities are also linked to his experience in los alamos.
he loved to break into military safes, where the plans of the atomic bomb were contained, only to show that the security measures taken were far from adequate to protect the bomb from the wrong hands.
even the military censorship, which for security reasons screened the correspondence of every individual in the base, had its hands full dealing with feynman.
at 5:30 am on july 16, 1945, the trinity test was held.
it seems difficult to believe that feynman was discarded by the us army because he was considered "psychically deficient" and that, at the same time, at the age of only 25, he contributed to one of the most demanding military projects of all time, "harnessing" nuclear energy.
on the other hand, it is also strange to think that he risked not being admitted to a doctorate in princeton because of his votes were anything but excellent in english literature and general culture.

one is a familiar piece "peter and the wolf".
i am always fascinated by the music composed of the right rhythm, melody, and harmony, with the right tones!
the record was with a picture book and he liked the story.
he claimed to play this piece when he was in the university orchestra, but his request was rejected.
prokofiev is popular also in america, partly because he left russia, and after around two-month stay in japan, defected to america.
a player is really excited, saying his several decade-long dream came true.
the narrator at our concert is supposed to be performed by an ordinary person, who won this important role at the fund-raising auction for the orchestra operation.
those natures, i believe, are essential for an artist.
and it's also good for me loving his music..., and sharing those natures!
is there anyone who have ever tried invisalign after becoming adult?
i doubt on if it works because it looks just a normal mouthpiece.

life in the 21st century is better compared to the previous century. to what extant do you agree or disagree?
some people may argue that modern life is better than it was couple decades ago, while others think that life has changed dramatically but in a bad way.
i am inclined to believe that modern life is simpler and easier than it was a century ago because we cannot imagine our lives without goods of humankind which we use every day.
more than that, the way of understanding that life was better can be just a psychological feature.
firstly, modern life has introduced a myriad of advances in technologies like the internet, smart gadgets.
with the internet people can spend less time on everyday activities like the getting movie tickets, paying bills and so on.
moreover, through the interner users can communicate, work or search for information very fast.
for instance, students can learn very fast and from home in order to not spend time on a road.
gadgets or domestic appliances make our lives easier too because people should not wash clothes or dishes by hands.
actually, there are many innovations in the medicine.
people can get the very high level of healthcare because technologies allow conducting very difficult operations.
in response, scientists have proved that people tend to think in this way, and subsequently, future generations will think that our century was better than their.
well, maybe it happens because of global problems which affect all population and people have to be aware of them.
however, a century ago they were puzzled by only their concerns.
whereas people argue that early life was saturated with big and very important discoveries, i can say that nowadays we still can see many leaps forward like ways to treat cancer or even space flights.
to sum up, despite people thinking that life was better a century ago, others cannot agree with it this opinion for a number of reasons.
i believe that de facto life is really better than it was a couple decades ago because our century combines all achievements of the past and people will further improve these things.

nowadays, people increasingly attend to college or university than the older generations.
they will spend 4 years or more to gain knowledge, meet a lot of friends, to imagine the future they will have.
there are several reasons can explain why people go to college or university.
firstly, people want to have a better job, and get a better salary.
in real life, if someone have a college degree, they will have more opportunity than people graduating from high school.
when my grandparents were teenagers, they could not have a bad job after graduating from high school.
however, today is totally different from the past.
in recent years, as the economy and technology develops, more and more companies require they employee have special abilities which only can learn in college or university.
they will have more opportunity to get a better job than other who do not have college degree.
this truth made us if we want to get a job we like, we need attend college or university to gain knowledge.
some people did not attend college or university because several reasons of outside.
like do not had money to paid tuition.
when this kind of people became rich or other reasons are gone, they will want to get a college degree to prove themselves.
just like a friend of my father, he got a college degree in middle-age.
this is so hard for him, because he has a regular job in day time, which mean he only can learned in the night.
and just like a normal college student, try to do everything to pass exam.
and now he became more confident at work.
thirdly, the most important reason i think is people are pursued their individual interest.
especially, in science distinction, like chemistry, physical, biology and other else.
science is very important in our life.
take chemistry for example, chemistry is a very difficult subject in science.
but chemistry made our life become more easily.
the reason i choose chemistry as my major is because i like to synthesize new thing.
personal interest pushes me attend university.
people attend college or university because different reasons.
like to have a better job, get a better salary, or just want to get a degree.
the most important reason is people are pursued their individual interest.
this will promote social development in the future.
based on the above reason, people attend college and university.
i don't join opinion poll recently.
i had the term-end exam last week.
i was returned the test this mornig.

i, but also family didn't care about mom as a woman.
however, it's too hard for her catching up normal daily life.
i think everything change so fast that she can't understand.
so she wants me to be a companion, every move, which i can't be for my job or other things belong to my life.
i always feel guilty for that.
i would appreciate it if you could help me to improve my writing skills.
it is true that there is still room for improvement about robot pets, but i agree with the use of them.
firstly, they can be useful in a medical field.
many researchers say they can heal mentally ill children.
secondly, they are very easy to take care of.
elderly people or parents both of whom are working may have difficulty in caring for living pets.
today, the number of children who are abused or mentally disabled is increasing, so robot pets can be helpful.
elderly people or parents both of whom are working may have difficulty in caring for living pets.
for these reasons, i think using robot pets has a positive impact on our society.
hotel serving diverse guests, so working as housekeeping is good opportunity to meet people from different countries for me.

if you want to master a language, you need to study it comprehensively at first.

socrates asked plato to go into a wheat field and pluck the biggest, goldennest ear of wheat for him.
the only rule was that he could only pluck one and could never go back on his way, only move on.
plato did what socrates told him, but came back without any wheatears in his hand.
i kept on going, but found nothing bigger.
the rule was the same.
he could only chop one and could never go back on his way.
it was not too shabby, so i chopped it down unless missing every thing like last time again.

i have been living in apartment after wedding.
it is calm living only me and my wife.
now, it is easy to live without local communication and no relayshionship of neighberhood.
but i decide to think of future.
in the beginning, when the market haven't reached saturation.
things are like the more you invest in, the more you will gain.
so at that time two brands, ofo and mobike arised.
there were very cruel competition between each other, a little like uber and didi before.
there were so various kinds of these that everything that you can't imagine can be found there for you to think of.
i particularly loved to walk around accessories counters as long as i went to fabric market.
unfortunately, it was hard to find out something useful there except some basic materials like beads and threads.
however, it seemed that they didn't fit into our works and they even looked like more awkward and cheaper with those buttons.
no matter these accessories that are produced by machine looked like how delicate but it's interesting that the handmade work always has a stronger visual appeal than industrial products.
that's why we rarely use those ready-made accessories into our work.
once you try to strive for excellence and you will find out that the excellence is just composed of countless details.
certainly, industrialization can greatly increase the productivity but it would never produce warm products.
whatever how precise the machines may be, they couldn't express emotions after all.
another characteristic point in boston is that there are seasons.
because i am from japan, i used to have seasons, but i had forgotten it after i lived in california for a while.

i enjoy snowy view in the city and mountains in new hampshire.

i believe or have confident that my english makes sense to them, but it's just my thought.
actually, they sometimes ask me what i say or to repeat certain words.
such times, i realize they make a lot of effort to understand my english.
sometimes, even though i explain something in different ways, i can't make myself understand, and they say "sorry i can't understand."
i'm a little sad at such times, but i convince myself that the issue is too difficult to explain, so it's not because of my poor english.
you would be upset if the analysis weren't as good as you expected, but it might be good for you to listen to such analysis to realize the weak points of your english.

of course, i'm sure i make the same mistakes on and on, so i should be careful about them too.
one of them has posted more than 1,000 entries, but he's never said "thank you" to correctors.
i don't remember the exact number, but it's only less than 300.
some kind people correct once, but he's never showed his appreciation to them, so they never come back to correct his entries.
i don't know when he could realize his own problem.
it's not easy to analyze your own english by yourself.
such times, i realize they make a lot of effort to understand my english.
sometimes, even though i explain something in different ways, i can't make myself understand, and they say "sorry i can't understand."

i'm gonna head to the north part of osaka tomorrow first time in almost six months.
my friend expected me to cook takoyaki at his home party.
to be honest, i don't feel like going there this time for some reason, but i'll be there, so, if you stay around there and have free time, let's meet up while i stay there.
my nearest station was renovated last month and there are many groceries.
because i work overtime, i often take out some food at groceries.
my husband seems to want me to be a good cooker during maternity leave, but i will be more depending on retort or frozen foods after child is born.
he already got married and he lives in sapporo now, also he has three kids!!
i wanted to tell this to him.
it seemed that he was happy to hear that.
our situation has changed a lot, but i
the e-books become more and more popular in nowadays.
there are a lot of argues about what kind of the book is the best.
some people think that e-books are death of paper books, but others think that paper books will never dead.
i think that it's obviously that e-books became popular because of compactness.
you can take it anywhere and it doesn't take so much space in your bag.
instead of a few books you can take only the one e-book and that is perfect.
however, i've heard that american researches revealed that the reading of e-books has a bad influence to rememebering of information because of standard fonts.
i agree with this research, because when you read print book you pay attention to book's layout design, fonts and colour of a cover.
also the e-books are the less esthetic that paper books.
you can't expirience that tactile sence as with a paper book.
for many people the paper books are still the best gift.
i'm doubt.
the good books capable to adorn your home.
when i come to someone i always pay attention on books, because it can tell many things about the owner.
in my opinion, paper books have more advantages and i think that e-books can't cancel them.
even if the technology will be learned to simulate the sensations as from a paper book, it will still be completely wrong.
i drink coffee or tea in every morning.
i selected a apple tea today.
the life with a dog
i've recently come to want a dog as a family member.
my friend's advise makes me hesitated to have a dog.
but i imagine how wonderful the life with a dog is.
my friend who had dogs told me that if i accept a dog to my family, i will have responsibility on it, for example, i have to take a walk for a dog every morning and evening, spend a lot of money to care and i can't leave a dog alone home because of my travel.
my friend's advise makes me hesitated to have a dog.
this tv show was aired in 90's when i was a kid.
in that time i could not watch the whole sitcom but i liked actually.
well, i could not watch the whole show because if i am not wrong only the fourth firsts seasons were aired in peru.
for example, i never watched that will was about to marry, that happened in the penultimate season, the fifth.

japanese language has imported a lot of vocabulary from very early times.
although words from indo-european languages like portuguese, dutch, german and english flowed into japanese language since around the 16th century, chinese kanji has made the foundation of japanese vocabulary.
i think it's very cool because it primitively denotes the pictures of the objects representing the beauty of simplicity.
there are over 2000 kanji characters and some of them were originally made in japan.
although i'm a middle-aged guy, i don't have got married so far, so i don't feel like getting consulted about this issue even though they want to talk something to me.

my friend hasn't gotten over from his depression of losing his wife even though he has tried to act strong.
although i'm a middle-aged guy, i don't have got married so far, so i don't feel like getting consulted about this issue even though they want to talk something to me.
i can't and don't want to say anything about the issue which i don't have any experience before.

"i advanced and asked him, " what was your story, bro?"
"he said," i had an astonishing story." " listen, one day i saw that a poor fisherman had caught a big fish and i liked it a lot." "i asked him to give it to me, but he refused saying that he sells it and buys food for his children." "i hit him, and took the fish out of his will and went."
"while i was walking carying the fish, she was still a bit alive that she bited my finger a strong bite."
"my hand pained that i couldn't sleep that night." " i went to the docoter the next day complaing my pain." "he said that i needed to cut my finger otherwise the pain would spread to the rest of my hand." "i did." "then my hand was in pain again that i couldn't rest or sleep."
" i went to the doctor and he prescribed to cut my hand.
i did so."
"after that the pain returened that i finally cut my arm."
"people asked me what was the reason of my amputed arm.
i thought then it was the story of the fish, so i recounted it to them."
"they said if i returned to the fisherman the first time i was in pain and asked him his forgiveness, my arm hadn't been cut." "go to him and ask him to forgive you before the pain spread to the whole of your bodey," they orderd.
" i searched for the fisherman everywhere in the town till i found him, and i kneeld seeking for his forgiveness."
"he asked who i was." i said, "i was the person who took the fish out of your will."
"i recounted the story to him and showed him my amputed arm." he cried when he saw it and forgave me."
"i asked him if he asked god something against me when i took the fish."
"he said yes he did." "i said, "oh, god he showed me, a week person, his strength.
oh lord show him your strength!"
it was a great pleasure to meet you.
thank you for the help you have done for me.
let me tell you about a little bit of myself.
so many years it took me to learn english only within the country.
i have never been abroad to study.
i have no experience to work with people from other countries.
i studied hard in order just to pass one of the most difficult english exams held in japan and did it, but after that, i burnt myself out.
i still had some difficulties in speaking english, which discouraged me to learn it anymore and made me feel blue for a long time.
soon this site captivated my heart by the favor of you who corrected my posts kindly every time.

writing english should be my habit, even though i'm too lazy.
however, i just realised english is more important than any other languages.
if i want to come back to china to work, english is inevitable.
i'm a little bit upset but still believe everything will be better and better.
i appreciate a lot.
when i looked out of the window i saw a bucket collecting rain drops in the yard.
yesterday was the last ocarina lesson day of 2017 fiscal year at a unique university for elderly people in nagoya.
the second grade students will graduate on march 26th.

some japanese people don't want to communicate foreigners.
perhaps, have you been ignored in train or shop?
in fact, they don't want to communicate other country people.
but, i think foreigners want to communicate more japanese people, right?
we should create "language learns" community.
as i previously posted a few times, i go jogging for about an hour every weekend.
until the last year, i was jogging while listening to music on ipod shuffle in which i put my favorite music in advance.
i selected songs which made me jog comfortably.
several months ago, i bought a portable radio player and i introduced it into my jogging.
since then, i am jogging while listening to the radio.
it's enjoyable for me because i can hear dj talking and encounter songs i've never heard before.
tomorrow, i will introduce a new item.
my wife is planning to buy me a high-functioning undershirts as my birthday present.
she said that she heard of the shirts from one of her coworkers who also has a habit of jogging.
he has participated in marathons several times before.
i'm looking forward to go jogging with the shirts.
could you introduce your favorite items if you like jogging.

i have been watching police videos lately on youtube.
cops protect the people, not harm them.
i understand that dealing with other people is a very tough job but they need to bide by the laws of the state.
sometimes i wonder whether the cops patrolling the streets are looking for some trouble because they get bored driving in their patrol car looking for some action.
for centuries, important parts of education have remained such as reading, writing and maths. with the advent of computers, some people think that computer skills be made as a fourth skill to be added to the list. to what extent do you agree?
first, i have an experience of working as a systems engineer and i could acquire computer skills on-the-job training.
secondly, it is more important to nurture creativeness.
for centuries, important parts of education have remained such as reading, writing and maths. with the advent of computers, some people think that computer skills be made as a fourth skill to be added to the list. to what extent do you agree?
it is a trend to teach computer skills at school.
there are pros and cons on this matter.
personally, i do not believe that computer skills should be made as a fourth skill to be added to the list of important parts of education such as reading, writing and maths for three reasons.
even though you become computer savvy at an early stage, computers can be totally different things when you are ready to start a job.
in conclusion, i do not believe that computer skills should be made as a fourth skill to be added to the list of important parts of education as i mentioned above.
does the word "obnoxious" sound too formal, or is it an okay word to use in any context?

what is written on drugstores' billboards in the us?
i haven't wore a necktie before i come to japan.
because usually we can wear anything we want at work in china.
and then i tried to tie it myself but i couldn't tie a triange-shape knot as well as other workmates.
everyday i take off the necktie without loose the knot and just tight it in the morning, so i forgot how to tie.
my teamleader and i talked about necktie today by chance, so i asked him to teach me the way tieing a good knot.
as the saying,use it or lose it, i decided to tie the necktie everyday in order to really remember it.
i haven't wore a necktie before i come to japan.

he is taking care of his wife who is in a serious illness.
she needs to suppress her symptoms by medicament, but in a result she has lost her spontaneous feelings and all of her social functions.
you know, au users can call without any fee under our contracts.
at first, i thought that i was helping him, but it was not the fact.
since he didn't have anyone to talk with, he couldn't even speak articulately.
however, a while after that, i realised that it was me who was encouraged by the conversations.

today, i downloaded the app called "timetree" and recommended my family to use it.
it looks easy to share our schedule, i was glad to find this app.

i wonder if it's always good idea to show them everything i do,

what we can do to help people with dementia
my dream is becoming a doctor who can diagnose the whole body of patients and listen to them in order to understand the situation where they are, such as their families, their occupations, and what they prefer.
about 30 years ago, people with dementia used to be said as stupid, inferior to others.
this assumption that dementia was embarrassing prevented them from seeing doctors earlier.
symptoms which appear in the brain of patients differ from person to person.
damaged cells in their brains make it difficult for them to memorize, realize, and judging things.
however, the cause of dementia is not only in their brain cells: their personalities, surroundings, and states of mind are also important.
when you communicate with them, keep your mind that there must be some "reason" why they act in such a way.
people around them may think they walk around without any reasons or just because they have dementia.
try to understand these actual reasons for their behaviors.
sympathize with them and respect them
communicate with a smile
i hope both people with dementia and their family will live smiley.
can you write characters beautifully?
writing beautiful characters is a valued ability in japan.
so many japanese children learns calligraphy to improve their skills.

question about english syllable
i haven't studied english that much these days ^^;
in japanese, a syllable is usually made with a vowel and a consonant, so the rhythm of the japanese language is kind of monotone.
i'm sure that when japanese people speak japanese, we unconsciously recognize each syllable.
also, liaison often happens in english.
i guess except for linguists, where to separate syllables is not very important.
the important thing when you speak english would not be which sounds each syllable has but would be how fluent you speak the whole sentence.
what do you think about it?
i want to sleep well everyday.
however i want to study english.
i listen a voice recorder before sleeping.
i sleep immediately.
my voice recorder is always sounds by itself.

when he died, his son john of orleans inherited of this earldom.
if what you were taugth became reversed
i read some books which were written by authors of about 80 years old.
they experienced the same thing.
they were taught by their teachers during the war that japanese emperor was a god and they must fight against the u.
s with their lives for him.
however they were taught by their teachers after the war was over that japanese emperor was just a human and the u.
s was a friend who would teach us democracy, human rights and free.
they say that they clearly remembered that immediately after the war was over, the considerable parts of school textbooks used during the war were painted in black with charcoal and their teachers taught them the opposite of what they taught during the war.
they say that they can't trust nations and that they knew thought of people changes instantly from the experience.
they worked hard and became a driving force for economic development of japan.
however they had the intensive experience like that when they were children.
can you guess if what you were taught became reversed.
the pure nature of our mind is covered by the inflicted emotions.
i felt strange sensation when i looked at a selfy photo of my dad he sent me yesterday.
what i felt at the moment is hard to describe.
he looked a totally different person from the man i know.
first, i attribute this with the fact that i have rarely gaze at his face though we lived together for very long time.
therefore, my brain got confused when trying to recognize him as my father because what i have imaged as his face in my brain was far away from his real face.
second, brain has innate ability to overlook unnecessary information on purpose.
in my case, the information of my father's face were recognized as unnecessary information and slipped from my brain because i though i knew his face already and no need to update the information.
i keep thinking about adding "away," but i have a feeling that i could take it out in the previous sentence.

as the world becomes technologically advanced, computers are replacing people at more and more jobs.
for instance, several decades ago, people had to say in a queue in order to buy movie tickets.
however, nowadays, in cinemas, we cannot find ticket boxes, instead, there are a lot of terminals where we can easily buy them.
another example is banks.
we should no longer go to a branch of a bank in order to do these things and wait until our payment reach the addressee.
more than that, all transactions are fulfilled by computers, not people as it was several decades ago.
there are many situations when a client needs help or he cannot understand the interface of a computer, only customer services can help him.
another example from the movie "passengers" where the whole spaceship is breaking down because of one asteroid and only passengers can fix up it because even the very smart systems cannot deal with it.
in spite of the fact that computers are quite successful, they cannot fully replace people because they often have some problems, work only as the programmed and cannot think.

the european union began exporting around 16 million tons of wheat in 1985, by 1986 fell below australia, having 14 million tons of wheat exported.
surprisingly, the exports showed a vertiginous increase, finishing the period being the biggest wheat exporter with 21 million tons.
finally, canada started being the leader of the group with 19 million tons, then it experienced a slight decrease in 1986 with 16 million tons.
in 1988 reached a high point with 25 million tons of wheat, the highest exports of the period among the group.
however, about 15 years ago, it began to be called women's day.
on women's day, working women can have a half day off and get gifts from their companies.

since workers spend most of the day at their work place, bosses should procure that work environment is as healthy as possible.
respect is an important quality for a boss to have.
of course the boss can and must draw attention to whatever that should be done, but always with the best manners.
bosses must know that yelling at people or using inappropriate language will not inspire any respect, quite the opposite, it would produce a barrier that would hinder them from good communication.
another important feature that every boss should have is exemplar conduct, meaning, to behave coherently.
the boss must seek for fair conditions such as a good wage and health insurance.
a good boss should look for generating the best conditions for the workers.
employees who feel their needs are taken into account and feel appreciated will perform much better than those who feel they are disregarded.

jones, martha's family doctor told his wife a story what happened.
"before three days i cured a patient.
she had a headache and nausea, so i though about indigestion.
i put her a strict diet.
she didn't better, so i wanted to take her to the hospital for a check-up.
this morning, when i arrived to their house martha was death.
suddenly, her husband - who incidentaly kept his wife very carefully - came and give me an envelop with full money.
he asked me i write heart attack reason of death into the death certificate.
the envelop was very fat, so i wrote it what he asked of me.
did i it well?"

people usually go to college or university in early 20 years old.
they will spend 4 years or more to get knowledge, to meet a lot of friend, to image the future they will have.
compare to the elder generation, recent years, people increasingly go to university or college.
i think there have several reasons to explant this phenomenon.
frist, they want to have a better job, get a better salary.
back to the time when my grandparent were still teenage, they could have a not bad job after graduate from high school.
but, as economy and technology develops, more and more companies need someone have special ability which only can learned in college or university.
this request us if we want to do a job we like, we need to attend college or university to gain knowledge.
second, they want a degree.
just like a friend of my father, he got a job after graduated from high school.
when the time past, a voice in his heart start yelling, i want to have a degree from college.
get a degree in college is very hard thing for a middle-age man who have a regular job.
but, my farther did it.
and this make my father more confidence.
third, they want to promote social development.
some subjects, like chemistry, physical, biology and other science subjects is very important in our life.
just like chemistry, everyday a lot of new thing are synthesis in the world, maybe many of they are useless, but something in there will change our life in many years later.
to gain knowledge about chemistry need to go to a college or university.
when i synthesis something new, maybe do not better than the thing extant, they will make me to be better, and in one day, i will synthesis something new and useful.
the hot cake of the shop seems like so fluffy.

i read a report written about experiences that the nepalese had in japan.
i will share with you that.
she gave up getting her doctor's degree while living in japan and thought if he had moved to europe, she also could have gotten a degree because of the equality of the sexes.
it refers that wives must serve their husband and family and stay home.
the idea sometimes annoyed even japanese wives and much more foreign wives.
some japanese-specific customs would be obstacles for foreign people when japanese society is changing to the international.
i read a report written about experiences that the nepalese had in japan.
her husband moved to japan to get a doctor's degree.
a followed him and she also wanted a doctor's degree in japan, so she discussed getting her doctoral degree with a professor who teaches her husband.
the professor told her that getting a doctor's degree was very difficult.

a man who has just released from prison
in the part i was reading the other day, a miserable man wearing worn-out clothes who looks very miserable has just passed by the church.
even though, the man told the priest that he was an ex-prisoner, the priest didn't mind about that at all.
this is a continuation of my previous entry in english.
he had been in a prison for 19 years, and he was just released from prison.
hello, i'm dolce.
but he had an exception: he cared his clothes so much that he would spend most of his money on it to be well dressed.
surprisingly, he would change his coat every hour!
the great city he ruled was very gay, to which a lot of visitors from all over the world would come every day.
the emperor heard about very beautiful cloth.
they told him that they could make a supreme suit.
they also told him that it had a unique point: it would be invisible to those who were stupid or not qualified for their positions.
the emperor first had his honest, aged ministers go to see the cloth because he was a little bit nervous whether he could see it.
they returned and said to the emperor, "the cloth couldn't have been more beautiful.
he was pleased, ordering the swindlers to make a nice suit.
now i am in the bus to haneda airport.
outside is unfortunate rain.
i am worried that my suitcase on the canvas will get wet.
i have looked it up on the net now.
there seems to be a way to cover an ordinary super bag.
is there a sim card only for data?
i am mainly in charge of brewing in the present winery.
i have experienced wine making for 5 years.
it is my first experience of brewing overseas, i am looking forward to it.
because the sweet niagara was cloudy, i returned it to the tank and refilled it.
i packed it in the winter without cooling process, so i think that tauter stone came out.
what do you use in case of supplemental acid?
how many years have you aged in barrels?
if you do not mind, please come to our wineries this autumn.
urbain winery is also popular recently.
i agree with this statement that daily homework is important for students.
for example, when i was in junior high school, mathematics was one of the most challenging subjects because theories and formula were too complex.
tanaka, i was able to understand this subject smoothly.
he gave his students a few questions as his daily assignments which were highlighted every class.
therefore, these enabled me to make sure what to do and grasp both my strengths and my weaknesses on each topic through his feedback.
in the end, i was able to keep up with his classes and received higher scores than other subjects.
secondly, daily homework enables students to obtain specific skills.
yamaguchi, imposed his students to a variety kind of group assignments every day.
this was heavy burden for me, in particular, short presentations about daily news after discussions with my classmates.
therefore, i was required to prepare for the speeches perfectly for his questions after my performances.
however, although his course was too tough, i was able to improve my communication skills.
that is because in order to make great impressions to him and get high scores, i had to consider everything related to public speaking, such as proper gestures, facial expressions and the contents of stories.
in the end, i was able to learn the tips on communication, and made full use of them in admission interviews when applying for universities.
i agree with this statement that it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure everything is correct.
first of all, quick work considering risk making allows business to be efficient.
for example, i own my trading company and decided to start up business in southeast asia ten years ago because of shrinkage of local market, although it was risky due to little knowledge about foreign business and few foreign friends.
in general, i seriously examine it after coming back to japan, but i contracted with a local agent then.
this was correct to do foreign business because there were countless competitors in the world.
as a matter of fact, some business persons investigated the estate next day.
secondly, working slowly and making sure everything is correct is not a good idea to do tasks.
for instance, when i was a freshman as a sales person, i always conduct assignments quickly although they are not perfect.
that is because seriously thinking was a waste of time, and i was able to get lots of feedbacks from my bosses.
when i was required to make a presentation material in a board meeting in two weeks, i submitted it after two days first, even though i completed it by only 60%.
in the end, i was able to complete the final document with his satisfaction on time because i had enough time to brush up.
if i would have not submitted it until completion, i would not have gotten any feedbacks and made the low-leveled product.
as this example mentions, you should not aim for perfection, doing tasks in business.
in conclusion, i strongly believe that working quickly and risk making mistakes in more important than to work slowly and make sure everything is correct because of success of business and effectivity of tasks.
i ordered it as soon as i found it at amazon because the introduction said it deals with an issue i have been thinking for a long time.
however, i was disappointed to find that it was a vertical writing book.
vertical writing books for science or technology in japan are generally regarded as for non-professional people.
if you are not familiar with the japanese custom in publishing, you might be surprised to see that equations are written vertically in the books.
i cannot understand the custom.
it features very obscure baseball topics such as sacrifice fly or home steal every time.
they really think how they can do better and practice over and over again.
usually, ordinary people tend to overlook the things the show feature, but professional people think of them differently.
they really think how they can do better and practice over and over again.
i think that makes them so successful.
it is rainy and cold today.
i told her we didn't go out because it was rainy but she didn't understand.
i wonder if she was a dog she could understand what i say.
it is rainy and cold today.
i wonder if she was a dog she could understand what i say.
recently i've been into watching big bang theory, american sitcom provided by netflix.
i'm pretty sure watching it repeatedly helps me improve my listening skill, so will keep watching.
it was like any other day in the alice academy and the classes go by without problems in all the campus.
the students of the classroom 3-b were talking freely without care about that the noise they were doing can be heard in the hall.
it was the study hour for them and like since they were in the elemental levels, the students of the 3-b classroom only do what they want to do.
despite of them being in the senior year and that the teachers have taught them for many years, only a few could teach a whole class without interruptions, forget about maintaining the classroom in order during the free hours.
the nineteen students were divided in their group of friends.
you could say that if the classroon respect someone that would be natsume.

women are happy to receive presents and compliments in this day, while men are happy to pay extra attention to their loved ones.
none of them is left without a present or special attention on march the 8th.
probably, it is difficult for men to congratulate many close women in one day.
however it is always pleasant, to receive gifts and congratulations.
i get a feeling for pakistani country culture.
timkey, the main character, desperately wants her basic rights, but the family, especially, aman wadi, her grandmother who is very orthodox, stands in the her way.
i was especially moved when i read the part about her not being able to go to school any further.
i understand the culture is different than what i am accustomed to, however it infuriated me that everyone cowered to the elder mother.
that makes me sad and curious to read further to know if she gets them or not and what happens to her next.
the author has already pulled at my emotions with certain scenes in the story- the reader is pulled in further in the story when complex philosophies and religious concepts are discussed between timkey and her cousin, azeem.
i feel i'm in the room and feel like i belong there.

he lived alone there for four years, and came back home several times per year, but i've never been to his apartment.
therefore, i was worried if he kept the apartment clean.
the day before his move, i packed a lot of different cleaning tools in my luggage, took a bullet train for about five hours, and arrived at his apartment.
i was also happy to see him, but his room was really messed up.
i know that it tends to be messed up during a preparation for move, but it was too much dust and dirt!
i thought that he hardly had ever cleaned the apartment.
i asked him why the living room was still this dirty.
he said that he was cleaning the kitchen and the bathroom an entire day, before i arrived here.
those places might have been the dirtiest.
that seemed to be his way of showing his caring because it's too tough to clean a sink or a basin area.
next day, we was completely done the packing, and then the moving company carried out them.
after that, we swept the vacant room again, and left the apartment.
i thought that i need to tell him that keeping all things clean is essential for a healthy lifestyle.
a person we've known each other was looking for a family who can let them stay over a night and ask me.
all my family is shy and we aren't talkative, either, so i hesitated to accept it for a while.
but it sounds fun and also will be a good experience, so we decided to accept it.
one of them has been studying japanese for a few years but the other people don't.

buy second hand
different ways exist in switzerland to buy such items.
we have second hand shops that are open all year round.
they get a lot of their offer from clearing out flats from elderly persons who died or had to go in a rest home.
in addition, we have flea markets in the streets mostly from spring to autumn.
another form is a sale organized by volunteers that offer to sell your objects in a given period.
you get your money or your objects back at the end of the selling period.
these sales help to find clothes and sport equipment for children within a reasonable price.
for me, money is...
in 20's i wanted to stand up on my feet based on earning money by my self.
after marriage, money became my everything because my husband had a huge debt, which i didn't know before marriage to him.
after that, i have needed money for 'a normal life', which my parents gave me for my liberty.
now, 40's, money is something valuable for my elegant senior life.

but they take me to their house so i was surrounded by their fellows.

i think their behavior is really weird but i guess they don't think they are weird.
i am hearing a conference presentation in english by japanese person.
very poor english.
what's that they are having over there?
i think the reason there are many badly structured books in japan is that there are no writing training in school.

it is the best to hide under a durable table as soon as possible.
closing
so, what should we do?
the most important thing to do in an earthquake is to be safe, so we should immediately take cover and protect our heads in an earthquake.
if outdoors, to prevent ourselves from being hurt by falling signs, we should also take cover as fast as possible and stay low until it ends.
during driving, we just need to slow the car and park it beside the road, turn off the engine, and wait until the end of the earthquake.
when an earthquake hits, the frame of a door might be deformed making people trapped indoors. therefore.
if not, find a place to hide under as the first priority to save ourselves, and then open the door after the earthquake.

and my favorite film on which she acted was the 1981 film titled "the night the light went out in georgia", which was translated into "good-by georgia" in japanese.
and intriguingly, mark hamill aka luke skywalker acted as a local cop.
the movie was filmed around the time the first series of star wars were being made, i suppose.
as for star wars, i heard that the new marvel film "black panther" has been succeeding more than the latest start wars film "the last jedi" and so i think i'm going to watch it this weekend.

the other day i saw it at a nearby supermarket.
if eldely people feel anxious or scary,a geverment recomends them to return their car's licenses by themselves to the police.

also i think it's necessary for elderly people to have them in unconvenient places.
we usually say 'it is repeating that it gets worm after the rain' each other as a greeting here in march.
recentry, on tv i have sometimes watched a news report that an elderly person mistakenly steps on the brake the gas pedal and finaly crash into a supermarket.
i found something about british people.
for example, first of all, they are proud of own country very much.

however, now that the us is leading the world and china is top of asia.
winter is getting over, and the spring is about to begin.
i've been waiting for the season to come.
speaking of the spring, it signifies a significant season for graduated students to start off a member of society.
they become a new employee, and have to adjust to a society, which is completely different from when they are a student.
i remember the first company i joined in as a new employee.
the company was a retail company.
i was in a hands-on training a few weeks with another new employees.
they were fast learners than me, so i was in a frustrating situation where i asked myself why am i so slow to learn whatever things i learned.
however, the things changed, once i got over it.
i asked someone that i looked up to, and they gave me advice,which was to keep four words in always my mind.
it was a "being helpful, quick, friendly and knowledgeable." since i've kept that in my mind.
a boy held and shake her backpack while she was carrying it, saying to her that she cried so easily.
i made him come and say sorry to her, and asked him why he does to others what they don't want him to do and why he kicks his friends so easily.
he told me that his mother forced him to have his hair dyed so he doesn't want to be abused due to the blond hair.
i was very sorry to hear what he said and reflected not to realize how he is feeling.

if you do miscellaneous too much, you cannot do your own important job.
i may be tired much these days.
probably i should take a holiday.
exhausted weekend
hello i'm tak.
i started to live in germany at the beginning of march.
in germany, there is no furniture in the apartment.
so i had to buy all of furniture that i need.
in the last weekend, i went to ikea.
i bought two beds, one double deck bed, two closets and one kitchen counter.
my car is too small to bring all these items.
so i had to go to ikea four times to bring them.
it was exhausted.
to make matters worth, only eleveter in my apartment is broken.
i had to take them from underground parking to my room that is in third floor.
total of the items are 250 kg.
it was very exhausted.
recently, there are many rainy days.
it is forecast that it will rain today as well.
it changes from snow to rain because of rising temperature.

i want to take a picture, because i can't take a picture these days.
anyway, i'll go to have fun today too!!
these past three weeks, i've continued watching american movies, sitcom and tv shows with english subtitles.
it has been kind of making me crazy because, suddenly, my only hobby which is watching movies turned into practicing matters.
nevertheless, i don't regret this experience because i realized some pronunciation stuff.
i don't know how to say it but thanks to english_questions channel and my jedi masters i enjoyed to practice it.
you know what i am saying?

i rushed toward a bookshelf i had right beside my bed as the footsteps kept growing stronger and stronger.
i took my favorite book, teared off it's leather cover and placed it on the tome, completely hiding it's blue color.
i turned toward it, to only find my father's furious gaze hitting me.
"oriel, i asked you, and will not ask you again, where your mother is" he furiously said.
i still remember how a huge drop of sweat was traveling through my forehead, gently tickling my skin.
he swiftly stepped toward me and extended his thick skinned hand toward mine, pulling it up.
i followed the tome with my eyes while it was dropping, and saw how easily he caught it midair.
a while ago he was all over the news, because he accounted for the greatest leak of secrets in the history of u.
the question i would like to answer: is he a hero or simply a traitor?
soon after, he landed at a job with the c.
but he quitted after being suspected of attempting to break into classified files.
a., he first discovered corruption in the government.
intelligence gather, process and distribute the information.
revealing information will have a short-term effect, but revealing the process is going to have a really harmful effect on the american intelligence for a very long time.
compare this with a baker.
if i gave the whole town his famous apple pie for free, he will see a little decline in sales.
but if i put the recipe of his famous apple pie online, this would have a long lasting effect.
i have to regist my photograph to take part in sxsw.

i can't catch what the video below says around 1:20, could you help me understand xxx part in the sentence?
leaving task to others
they think that they would rather finish their task by themselves that teach others how to handle the tasks because it's faster.
if we can't others our tasks to others, we can't do something because what only one person can do is limited.
in fact, it may be true, but i think these people may lack the ability to grasp what the others can do and can't do.
being afraid the sick house syndrome of my wife, i arrived home earlier yesterday again.
it was lucky that the chemical condence in the air wasn't as strong as we had been afraid.
however, it was still harmful for her that she got a headache.

i decided to sell two of my cars, because i was told by my company to go back to japan permanently after five-year-stay in the us.
i didn't want to waste my precious time by negotiating a lot of dealerships.
i learned how to sell a car at maximum price when i sold my car last time.
after inspecting the cars, the salesperson tried to ask at what price i wanted to sell them.
i told him that kelly tended to give a lower range of evaluations.
when i told him that i would go to the carmax tomorrow, he gave me the higher price than i expected.
i went to guam a few years ago, which was a last trip abroad i took.
i went to that trip with my wife and enjoyed it.
however, many people speak japanese in guam and i saw a lot of japanese there, for example, on signboards, on map and so on.
if i go to a foreign country next time, i want to go to one where i can never see japanese anywhere because i could feel that i would be away from japan and surely be in a foreign country.
also, i could check my english skill there.
i expect i could experience various fun things there.
i want to go to a country warmer than japan since i can become cheerful in warm climate.
which country are you want to go?
last week i had a history class for japanese who lives in london.

coca-cola company announced that they were going to sell canned vodka and soda here in japan.
although it is limited only in japan, for coca-cola known as a soft drink company, selling alcohol drink is very unusual.

"this is much, much more question asking than you will hear when adults talk to adults."

i haven't posted for a few days because the lang-8 system didn't work well from saturday to yesterday.
while it didn't work, as i wrote in my last entry, i expected that the administration was preparing for opening lang-8 for new members, but unfortunately, it seems that the system was only down.
by the way, has someone found that the lang-8 administration announced about this system down?
when it started not working well, i checked their twitter and facebook, but i couldn't find any comments about it from them.
now, it's working well, but if i were a member of the administration, i would apologize to the members that they had to go through the difficult time.
i'm sure premium members had the same situation, so at least, the administration should do it for premium members.
i can guess the administration worked hard to fix the problem, but they should say something to members.
i don't understand why the owner of such a language site don't want to try to communicate with members in words.
since i've been using lang-8 for 8 years and similar things have happened many times, i've gotten used to their attitude, but i still want to tell them that it's important to let members know what's going on when such a thing happens.
lang-8 started working normally!

in certain jobs, for example, sales, telemarketers, the employer will look for a native or a person with a native like pronunciation in spanish.
so maybe for someone who has learnt the language after puberty is nearly impossible to sound exactly like a native 100% of the time.

nowadays, modern life has become easier because of advantages in technologies which have changed our life dramatically.
however, this causes many problems like addiction from gadgets among children, and consequently, they spend less time outside, resulting in health concerns and other problems.
firstly, there is a multitude of children have been playing on the phone from childhood, this means that now they cannot imagine their life without it.
so, if they have a chance to go play outside or stay home, they will choose the first option because children like their phones more than active games.
the reason for that can be that they did not have such experience.
parents can urge adolescents to go outside if they forbid to use gadgets for several hours.
as a result, teenagers will like outdoor activities and will use their gadgets less in the future.
secondly, the more adolescents spend their time on computers, the less they healthier because they have a passive way of life.
for instance, teenagers can let themselves go and even do not notice it because they are fully immersed in their gadgets.
finally, a stature because of a bad vision is quite widespread health scare.
maybe some parents had thought that it would pass, but they failed because it is not a period of growing up.
parents have to control the screen time of their children and learn them how to distribute their time.
for example, there is a myriad of tough films and games which influence badly on adolescents.
this problem can be worse if children do not play with peers in active games outside because it allows them to relax, take a break, and take their mind off of such games.
without such activities, it leads to health cuts.
to sum up, as i have written, computers, smartphones, tablets and other gadgets leads to the lack of time outside and severe health problems like health concerns, psychological problems and the lack experience of active games with friends.
in order to help speedily these people, parents and doctors have to combine their efforts and help them.

others prefer the time before discovering technology.
in my opinion, i agree that technology has made our world more comfortable and convenience.

also, you can visit any country in the world by the invention of airplanes.
on the other hand, the electronic devices are very great instruments for us.
it give huge benefits for humans.
there are massive numbers of electronic devices that are considered nice and we have accustomed to use them, like smart phones, computers, hair dryer, iron, heater, etc.
secondly, all what i mentioned above in one hand and the invention of the internet in the other hand.
the internet gives us a lot of opportunity that we have never imagined before.
by the internet, you can download bunch of books and read from them anytime you want and anywhere.
also, by the internet, you can communicate with any person you know or if you want to make new friends by using social media.
you can search about jobs by specialized websites on the internet.
you can go shopping by the internet, you can order delivery foods from any restaurants by the internet.
you can study, entertain, and a lot of things the internet can introduce it to you.
that are difficult to count.
by the internet, our world become closer to each other than before.
to conclude, for sure there are disadvantages for any invention but in general, technology has more advantages that i mentioned above that made our world best place to live and enjoy it.

a lots of pollen recently cover tokyo.
i'm badly suffering from allergy.
especially inside of my nose is sore.
i took some medicines last night.
i wish that the pollun have gone soon.
i want to improve my pronunciation better.
to be honest, i don't really like japanese accent.
so since i began studying english, i have been caring about it.
yesterday, i filmed myself to make a self-introduction video.
it was actually the first time that i listened to my voice that is speaking in english.
and then i noticed that i still have the japanese accent.
i think my pronunciation is not too bad, but still sounds like japanese accent.
i want to speak with a natural accent...
so i decided to record my voice every day and try to figure out what is my problem.
i can't do by myself!
my birthday is 11th mar.
many people died of the earthquake.
i thought it was just normal one.
my wife, we had not married yet at that time, booked a restaurant at night to celebrate my birthday and we enjoyed the dinner together.
after we parted, i stopped by a bar near the dorm i lived at that time.
the old couple run the bar and i often contact to them even now.
i knew how serious and devastating the damage was there for the first time.
since one of my best friends lived in the disaster area, i was really worrying about him and tried to call him many times.
my family celebrate me, i appreciate them and i feel really happy.
i will take a toefl test in the middle of may.
hoping to find a friend,a teacher in here.
love you all!!
since one's personality is more complicated than it looks, you cannot understand other people completely.
nevertheless, just exchanging a few words with a stranger can make you feel as if you had known him for decades.
this kind of misunderstanding sometimes becomes the start of a long friendship.
i knew then, that in germany they have no cicadas.
stinging into the stones, the locust's trill.
i wonder why he used the "locust" instead of "cicada".
not so long ago, as i watched some tv program reporting german travelers visiting japan, they looked intrigued by the sound of singing cicadas.
they didn't seem to have any idea about the source of the sound.
i knew then, that in germany they have no cicadas.
cicadas live only in warm countries like japan and therefore i suppose most europeans don't make out the singing of cicadas.
i took it for granted that there would be full of singing sound of cicadas in mid-summer seasons.
the memories of summer vacations in my childhood could be evoked accompanied by those ringing sounds of cicadas with a feeling of nostalgia.
moreover, march is the end of a year here.
acturally, i don't like busy schidule but i try to enjoy enjoy parties.
i bought new clothes and had my hair cut to begin with.
i had headache from yesterday that probably cause to the hay fever.
i drank medicine, so i hope heal it quickly.
how long keep it?
i'm fed up it.
i hope the cedar pollen don't scattered in air.
i regret not having done my best on my gpa.
it is not highly considered when enrolling graduate schools and applying for jobs in japan.
on the other hand, it gets indispensable in many respects in foreign countries.
i am being confronted with my low gpa score.
unfortunately, there is no way to turn it over to very high scores for a student who is about to graduate.
i should have known better than goofing off with my friends during classes!

most worst thing for health is...
i thinking that most worst thing for health is getting something too much even work out, have vegetable, get stress, ext...
at the time, i thought that most worst thing for health is getting stressed even though i didn't know why is it worst thing for health lol.
why i thought getting something too much is i have some experience people around me.
first one is about seafood.
one of my friend worked at fishmarket, then she has been having rest of seafood almost everyday, unforthnately she was had seafood allergy by too much having seafood.
it is same thing work out, get stressed too.
if you work out harder that would be brake your health some day.
if you had been getting stressed, it would be brake your health.
these days, i visited kagoshima for trip.
kagoshima is where those who contributed to meiji revolution are from.
then i came the sea in order to go fishing.
kagoshima has beautiful sea and abundant of fish.
syrian civil war. are we getting used to watch painful images?
the civil war in syria is lasting seven years now, and it doesn't seem that a finish or peace is proximate.
the war began in the first months of 2011 among of protest of arab spring, across many arabian countries.
the peace protests in syria were dissipated with violence, with guns, even shelling against inoffensive people.
since then, every day there are heartbreaking videos and pictures which show the pain of the syrian people amid of the war.
about this war, there are a lot of audiovisual material, there are many witnesses, victims, and survivors who show how they struggled through the war and their suffering.
of course, there had been attempts at finishing this war, united nations, europe union, among others but the failure was a constant in those attempts.

so many years have passed and it seems that we are normalizing indifference to what is happening in syria.
the ads are really various, but most of the ads that i've seen most are about english schools.
i'm not sure why they want to advertise although they are already known in japane.
i think one of the reason is that it's common that many japanese can't speak english, so they want to take an advantage of it as a business.
japane is one of the top developed countries, but obviously we are behind developing countries in terms of english.
we have not learned spoken english, we've learned written and listened english through exams.
it is irritating to deal with them.
he made me an eye contact first, and then
you can have one.
jone some sweets.
4  did you give your elder sister any present for her birthday?
the reason why i had to come here is that i tried to work at vfx company.
i have got used to it but i have felt i need english skill more recently because although i can work with my current english, i have some situations that are difficult for me to explain.
so i start to keep a diary log here

on the episode, they covered a story on an american man who live in a village at risk of dissapearing and work as a community-reactivating cooperator squad.
he is 31 year old but he is the second youngest person after a high-school kid in the village and he is like a son of all the residents.
he said that he kind of upset when somebody say to him that he can use chopsticks very well or call him with his first name like western style while they call other japanese worker with "san" as a polite way.
he think he is the same with them so he wants them to interact with him just like they do to other japanese.
i had never thought that kind of things so i bet i would say those things to people from abroad.
i think that means that he had been soaked into japan that much though.
i wonder if he will go back to his country or find a job and stay in the village or anywhere in japan.
i wish he would come to my town because now they are hiring community-reactivating cooperator squad!

today i watched the movie " your name".
the movie is in set in both the big city of tokyo and the japanese older country side.
so you can find not only traditional old town and rural scenery sorrounded by beautiful mountain and nature but also the latest brilliant view of a city.
the movie made me nostalgic because i was born in country side and lived in tokyo.
after i go back to japan, i'm going to visit the real place used in the movie.

he told me that he had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars for the first year because of no customers.
i have heard many times that more than half of new restaurants close door when one year passes.
he told me that it's very important to know about it, because most restaurateurs get so anxious that they give up their business before fruitful second year comes.
choosing a topic has always been hectic for me.
so, i thought to seek help in choosing a topic from my sister whom i had an argument with just a few minutes before regarding my old garment that she wants to throw away, but i want to still wear it.
i asked my sister to say any word that i can write about.
but, i started wondering what makes the things nasty.
how could you stop things from being nasty?
lastly, we should avoid making opinions about somebody without knowing him.
there are situations where we start presuming things without knowing the actual reasons behind the situation.
please feel free to express your opinions regarding the same and i would love to hear on what things you agree or disagree with me.
please let me know any mistakes or any changes in sentence construction that you think can help in improving its quality.
we can use a simple one - dimensional value to express the emotion, the value of number is the intensity of the emotion.
if the value is less than 0, it indicates that there is a negative emotion, if the value is greater than 0, there is a positive emotion.
this is an illustration of the classification of emotions in the book "cognitive structure of emotion".
human subconscious will make a decision, but people always can't notice it.
human beings can not do pure rational decisions, decision making are mixed feelings and emotions.
conclusion: we could use machine to perceive the inner feelings that human beings can't realize themselves, so that people can clearly know what their real feelings are and their subconscious choices are.

lang, 1885 put forward similar emotional theory that the physiological changes of the organism form before the emotion.
so sadness is caused by crying rather than crying caused by sadness.
not shudder caused by fear.
however, this theory unilaterally emphasizes the role of the autonomic nervous system and neglects the regulation and control of the central nervous system, thus causing a lot of controversy.
button pressecperiment.
cannon, 1927 theory emphasized the integration of the brain, thus having the cannon-bard theory of emotion.
frontal lobe is an important part of the cerebral cortex.
as the command and control center of the brain, it can make decision functions and high-level thinking.
so we can come to the conclusion that the brain first makes the subconscious decision, and then produces emotional changes.

m life in the uk: do you want to work in japan? what cv is like in japan?
generally in japan, you have to prepare some official cv documents and you have to fill in by hand in japanese.
you have to take a picture of you and put it on like a passport.
it's depends on the company.
personally i think that cv in japan is really unfair as japanese society require your appearance, age and sex.
if you invited assessment or job interview, you should wear black or navy business suite like try not to stand out.
japan is still closed society unfortunately.
holiday in japan or being students in japan will be fantastic but woking in japan can be nightmare.

so it will be necessary that the muscles of our mouth get used to it.
it will be recommended to pay attention to the way spanish native speakers move the mouth, jaw and tongue, so that we can imitate those sounds when we talk.
it will be useful the help of a small mirror to check out if we are moving the mouth, etc, properly when we speak.
even people who haven not lived in a spanish speaking country might be mistaken with a native in a short conversation if they have worked very hard on their phonetics and intonation.

the second time i spoke with the romanian woman, knowing that she was not from spain, i paid close attention to her speech and i noticed some slips of the tongue every three or four minutes.
i previously wrote the an entry that our dog could put his feet in the door knob to open the door.

i admired his high learning ability.

my current job mission is to manage training session for managers.
our training session is divided into three types.
trainees repeat learning new skill and trying it at own workplace for six months.
this finding is key to upgrade and make successful organization.
third one is for upgrading test for general manager.
frankly speaking, i'm not so interested in preparation for upgrading test.
first one and second one let me know how trainees have changed.
this is my favorite factor of current work.
the most difficult concept in the foreign language is the style of writing.
maybe the style of communication, or "the manner", i'm not sure about the correct synonym.
it always slips away when i try to catch the right tone, the correct situation for a word or a phrase.
be sometimes ironical, sometimes silly, sometimes...
bureaucratical, that's a fun too, why not.
i already can enjoy some of the english stylistic games in the writing of others but only when they are emphasized.
and of course i can not repeat that trick on my own.
what of french...
i guess i can be consoled by the fact that i know three languages instead of one and i'm good at one of them!
not everyone in the world can enjoy the russian poetry in the original, right.

we have an old saying in chinese, "an old man loses his horse, but you never tell whether is bitter or sweet", which means the same as "misfortune might be a blessing in disguise".
this is quite suitable to describe my experience with the worn out phone.

i was like, why don't i just get a latest iphone if i have to pay that much?
it was a shame that apple doesn't have a rating system for their staff or i would definitely give him five stars.
the other good thing was that i got myself an ipad by the way, and there happened to be a special discount for uni students during the first month of the semester, plus a beats bluetooth headphone as a gift.
i am sick of my boss's lies.

my strength is to promote products from nothing by using sns or seo. and streamline sales process, create sales copy and etc.
otherwise, promotion doesn't go well.
until i get 30 years old, i didn't realize that there were not so many great product out there.
not only that, most of products suck. especially for small business owners.
most of them have little money, knowledge and experience.
after i found this fact, what did i do?
i kept thinking how value is created.
all the book as to start-up or anything similar didn't explain about that.
that was quite a difficult question.
interestingly, when i search for the word value in google, its definition is different in chinese and english.
in chinese, it's defined as "time it took" in short.
in english, it's defined as "how worthy or useful" in short.
anyway, i live in japan where capitalism is believed.

at my house we have still more than 30 eggs." for a while i was speachlos not being able to follow the story.
in japanese food culture, as long as i know, we don't use many eggs at a time.
it's over my imagination.
why did the person buy so many eggs?
i know, the answer is: "that's because eggs are cheaper on that day."
it's like a suggestion by hypnotism: "if you don't buy now, you will regret it in the future, and lose your money when you want to buy for the next time."
buying too many unnecessary food in a sale price still costs buying nothing.

for a short moment, this desperate fight in the air had captivated me just as as it had done with the staff sergeant, when i suddenly heard the rumbling of heavy boots from one direction and loud voices from another.

because of this information distortion, our project was delayed and our performances were not convincing.

i have asked our project manager why our company didn't send us on site earlier, "our boss underestimated the challenge of this project so that he was reluctant to do so," he replied.
surely i can't blame my boss for this unwise decision but we can take lesson from this experience to standardize development process.

pronunciation an accent
from point of view, this is the most problematic area to master.
it is very easy for children to acquire the accent and pronunciation of a language until they turn 5 years old.
however, after puberty it is very difficult to achieve a native like accent.
it is easy for children under 5 to produce the sounds of the spanish language or any other language without effort.
if a child has enough hours of exposure to the spanish language before turning five and continues having exposure to the language later, he or she will speak spanish with a native or native like accent.
however, after puberty, it is much more difficult to discriminate the sounds of a foreign language.
at this point, if you want to reach a native like pronunciation and action spanish you will have to use different strategies than a child.
a child grasps the sounds naturally, apparently without effort, but and adult needs to tackle this in a different way.

south korea has another presidential rule: almost all the ex-leaders are supposed to be charged guilty soon or later.
today, i heard news that the former south korean president lee myung-bak was summoned for his possible corruption by prosecutors.
it was just last year when south korean incumbent president park geun-hye was arrested and jailed.
i don't think this kind of law is favourable to south korean citizens, because the frequent change of political fundamentals may prevent many capable politicians from running a presidential election.

is it possible to speak spanish like a native for a foreigner?
there is a lot of controversy about this issue.
many people even consider irrelevant trying to speak spanish like a native.
i think it is possible for a foreigner to reach a point where he or she is able to speak spanish almost as a native.
if a student uses the right approach and devotes that necessary time, he or she will probably achieve a native like fluency in spanish.
in order to sound like a native speaker in spanish, you will need to achieve a flawless grammar and a native like accent.
i think that it is possible to attain a really good grammar in spanish throughout study.
but in order to achieve a native like level is necessary to reduce the mistakes practically to zero.
however, mastering sintaxis, acquiring a feeling of the language so that you can speak like a native is much more difficult, for many people it would require living in a spanish speaking country for years.
my english is very poor,i worry about it.

i read the absent in the spring by agatha christie 2 years ago and i was so impressive the story.
it's story about a women in a family who live in the uk.
the beginning is that when she think about her family on the way from her daughter to her house.
she was confident that she understood exactly what her family is and how her family should live to make a life better.
she believed that they followed her and proud of her.
but it's wrong.
her family hates her who put her thinking on them and never ever look back whether she was right of not.
because that story is likely happened on me.
when i look back my old memories, i had many experiences to express my thinking like her.
i'm not sure that is right of not.
what i learned from the book is having thinkings flexibly.
don't forced someone my thinking too much.
and have a brave to admit my mistakes.
i will have a experiences to express, but i never lose modesty and get arrogant.
do you like someone who is so particular about something?
someone who sticks to somthething and refuses to change his mind or way of doing it?
"when you made up your mind to master a certain skill, you need to be extra-particular about it.
there's no way around.
if you give in, it means you give up, and that's the level you reach."
i thought about it for a while and came to a conclusion that ther's a truth in what he says.
looking bakc, i loved playing basketball when i was in junior high.
we would shoot and remember every bit of movement from where to place our feet, how to hold the ball, where to place our fingers on the ball, when to start pulling the ball upwards, and so on, and on, and on, and on.
we had so many checkpoints from the beginning to the follow through of a shot that if we would really check everything one by one, we would have to move in a tremendously slow motion.
but after numerous practice, going through every checkpoint became just a pice of cake.
what happened was that we could shoot exactly the same way every single time, and shots were bound to go in.
what's more, even when we had to move our body differently for some reason, like getting pushed by the opponent, we could kind of "know" how to adjust our shots, and most of them went in.
days have passed and i'm so much obssesed about singing better now.
the issue is am i being particular about creating sounds at the same level as i was particular about making shots?
there are lots of signals that happens in my body that i'm overlooking.
i need to sense every tension and movements that happens when i start creating sounds.
if you give in, it means you give up, and that's the level you reach."
one day, me and my twin brother decided to master shooting.
we would shoot and remember every bit of movement from where to place our feet, how to hold the ball, where to place our fingers on the ball, when to start pulling the ball upwards, and so on, and on, and on, and on.
it could take us a whole afternoon to shoot one shot.

days have passed and i'm so much obssesed about singing better now.
it'll take time at first like it did in basketball shooting, but after it becomes a part of myself, i know i'll be able to reproduce exactly the same movements, which will enable me to reproduce exactly the same sound.
the project of 'kamakura of the earth' has started.
'kamakura of the earth' is an artwork by a creative team which is several types of artist and craftsman such as a plasterer, lighting artist, textile artist, designer, carpenter.

you'll notice a beauty of soil when your eyes get used to seeing darkness in the kamakura.
the concept of "kakishibu large noren' and ' kamakura of the earth'.
our daily night scenery has been changed very blight and convenient because of a great development of led technology.
on the contrary, blight lightings are everywhere in a town and our home.
therefore it is difficult to find out a luxurious darkness.
we noticed that when we turned off the light in our room and saw small lights of indicators.
we could feel relaxing when we see an existence of lights because of darkness, and a texture of a soil which illuminated by a weak light in a darkness.
we even could forget about a bustle of a daily life.

generally, the fattier the better and the fattier the pricier.
quality sushi also should have the right balance fish over rice.

it costs very cheap and i have became able to understand their english well, but i cannot hear native speakers ones, so i checked the price of native tutors' course.
it was very expensive and even the cheapest online company provides it 10 dollars for a 30 minutes class.

i used to use a hallo talk, which is a famous app for those who are language learners.
there were a lot of japanese wanting people from abroad to practice english, so it has more japanese who are learning english than those who are learning japanese.
i went online to look at an another app, and i found two apps that i can conect with people from other countrins, which were called "speaky", "hallo pal".
they have several differences compared to the hallo talk, but i don't feel anything about them.
these apps allow us to have an opportunity to have a chat with people from different counties.
you can practice your language that you are learning, and teach someone who are learning your native language.
i've made some friends on the hallo talk a while ago, and we went out many times.

there was a boom of this "blood type personality theory" in the 1970s and received a lot of media attention.
the blood type was one of the most popular topics mainly among young japanese those days.
according to this theory, a person who's blood type is a tend to have the traits of earnest, reserved and sensible, while a type-b person is passionate, active and creative.
i suppose that one of the reasons of this theory having risen up is the fact that type a constitute 40% of japanese population, type o 30%, type b 20% and type ab 10%.

when our group started this design project, the final interaction effect is actually not as expected as its imagined to be stunning.
however, due to the limitation of our programming ability, we are not able to write a perfect program, but in general, it is a playful interaction device.
just in a few seconds, audiences can explore the correct interaction way by themselves, and then complete the whole interaction experience within the next 10 seconds.
this is just a quick and short-fresh interactive process.

there were not for everyone so we decided who would get it using an app and i was selected as the last person.

i wonder if it's my misunderstanding, or i read something wrongly written.
i think it's always missing the part that you first see any doctor.
but the advice given sounds like saying you have to have a home doctor, but i don't have any home doctor in this foreign country, and i believe this situation can happen to anyone.
i just couldn't fill the missing information.
well, thinking about it, so many things in this world works like that, at least to some including me.
my son got really good grades in the exam he took the other day at a cram school.
simultaneously i thought he would get much better grades if he becomes a little bit serious and studies every day.
it is difficult to make children get habit of studying every day, however.
for even adults, it is difficult to get such a habit.
it may be said so because getting a habit is very difficult.

my life in the uk: japanese don't say " i love you" enough
in my country, words are nothing and action are everything.
it's easy to say nice things and cost you nothing.
love is tough and very strong words for me.
i think japanese believe that action with consideration is more important than saying " i love you".
you will know and feel how much you and your partner love each other through your action without saying "i love you"  i have an english husband but he doesn't overuse " i love you " which is good and it's just right for me.
i think maybe japanese don't say " i love you" enough but westerners use the words too much.
it's not good overuse them because it will lose the power of words.
however it's not that easy to take actions and sometimes it costs you.
you will know and feel how much you and your partner love each other through your action without saying "i love you"  i have an english husband but he doesn't overuse " i love you " which is good and it's just right for me.

as many people realized, the lang-8 was heavy the past few days.
now, it's recovering from such a status.
i was really frustrated at the heaviness since i use the lang-8 everyday.
i realized that the lang-8 is really important for me.
i strongly want to improve my english, so i need the lang-8.
i believe that i can improve my english by receiving corrections from my friends in the lang-8.
also, i thought that i should introduce some new english trainings.
i keep the following trainings now.
- writing english journals everyday and checking corrections by my friends.
speaking training is lacked.
i should introduce a speaking training, but it will be a bit hard because i probably can't find time to do the training.
so, i think it might be a good idea to replace one of the trainings with new one, or to do all trainings alternatingly.
today is very cold, even though it was very hot last sunday.
yesterday, she found a memo on my to-do list saying 'call on my parents to maintenance their pcs.'
she asked me about it and i told her that i would visit my parents near future.
i had never noticed that the visiting was stressful for her.
in such cases, the best solution to consoling her is just listen to her opinion, not saying any quibbles.
it is very hard to reach a agreement because everybody says whatever they want to day.
a lot of people doesn't face the reality of the situation and believe that their opinion must be accepted.
the problem is that every people has every opinion and one's opinion sometimes just seems to be ridiculous for others.
so, we have to keep looking for a compromise, even though others look sstupid.

mother's day comes on the second sunday in may.
it is celebrated in usa, england, germany and other countries.
it is also observed in ukraine too.
it is a day when people honour their mothers.
the most important holiday of ukraine is the day of independence, which is celebrated on the 24th of august.
we always celebrate this date.
the new year eve, christmas, easter are also celebrated in ukraine.
the new year eve is my favorite holiday, because we usually buy a new year tree, decorate our house with garlands, lay the table, dance and sing, have a lot of fun.
in our country people usually invite their friends to their homes, or visit their relatives and friends, or just stay at home with the family on holidays.
my city is located on the territory with a temperate climate.

i saw an announcement that informed the gathering in memory of misao jo in a newspaper yesterday.
then we decided to be a member to be allowed to weave there for a year.
she wrote back that she also used a saori loon and was going to visit saori headquarters.
since she never wrote her entry again, i lost track of her.
i saw an announcement that informed the gathering in memory of misao jo in a newspaper yesterday.
saori weaving is to weave on her handlooms.
we were able to use any yarns among innumerable kinds of yarns placed on shelves around.
then we decided to be a member to be allowed to weave there for a year.
i came across a very short japanese entry that an australian woman posted for the first time.
she wrote back that she also used a saori loon and was going to visit saori headquarters.
since she never wrote her entry again, i lost track of her.
saori weaving is to weave on her handlooms.
she just sat on a sofa or she wove on a loom when she was well.
question of comma
which is better or correct, a or b?
a: we can see a lot of english words and sentences in our daily lives.
b: we can see a lot of english words, and sentences in our daily lives.
you like to let your dog walks you instead of you walking him.
you like to let your dog walks you and not the other way around.
they were pretending that they liked the food that you cooked for them.
we've always been trying to agree with you.
the robber got arrested after being on the loose for two weeks.
they may have changed their mind, but they also look for more tourists and investments as what i have heard.
when people have better view over arabs they can extend it to the whole middle east, and the opposite is also true.
iran also claims that they try to provide more opportunities for women.
many women already work in different grounds, however there are actual limitations for women to reach higher political positions.
if saudi arabia do this, then there would be more expectation from iran to facilitate this.
for example, hijab is not mandatory in some arab countries, but it is in iran.
when this will be resolved or should this be resolved depends on many other factors, the important one is the pressure of people.
feel free to leave a comment; a reply is not guaranteed, however.
only if you die under the flag of our king,does it make being born in this country truly worthwhile.

i have to try several time before being able to access to the website.
nowadays, with the advanced technology, the world is getting more and more smaller.
however, most college students in taiwan do not know what the latest things happen in other countries.
the following are two reasons why i think college student acquiring an international student is an important thing.
one reason is that they are taking the high level education, knowing the international situation can help them doing research and getting more knowledge.
therefore, broadening international perspective can make college student get more job opportunities.
in my views, there are two essential to broaden their understanding of world events.
english is a common language of the world.
people who have excellent english abilities can get new information from other countries soon.
second, reading and analyzing the international news: after getting a news, they should try to understand why the things happen by searching online or asking the professors.
new year have left,spring is coming.
i like spring in the season.
because all of anything is grow up.
advertaising is an advantge for companies but the consumers, really need a great deal of advertising everywhere invading their minds?
but, where is the tipping point between information and manipulation?
some expert people claim that the advertising could be dangerous for the consumers because it encorage them to buy things they don't really need or generate an anxiety to consume that is harmful to their mental health.
in my opinion, the control of the advertising is a obligation for the goverment and it should harden the control mesures, especially in television, on the exposure to the flood of announcements that the consumers suffers.
or just me?
hope it will get back on track very soon!!!
lang-8 has been so slow and laggy these days.
does anyone know what happened?
i am working in hong kong but living in shenzhen.
my supervisor taught me how to do this and that in cantonese.
i am getting better in understanding cantonese but still, i have a hard time to catch all the meaning of my supervisor.
speaking in cantonese and writing in english, this is how people work in the accounting or finance industry in hong kong.
cantonese is a lovely language but i have difficulties in pronouncing it in a right way.
i showed my flower arrangement at the school exhibition on february.
i had made my work one month before from the exhibition day, but after few weeks, an important flower was a nothing at any flower shops.
so, i ordered it to a flower shop, but the shop couldn't get the flower the previous day.
i had to hunt around for my flower arrangement materials at other flower shops not only my town but also neighboring towns.
however, i couldn't find the flower out so, i decided to go to more far towns from here.
when i drove to there, i looked at a small flower shop in my town.
i had never go to the shop, but i stopped over the shop, just in case.
after all, i couldn't look at the flower.
when i was disappointed in front of a flower case, salesoerson asked me "may i help you?"
i told her about a story how many shops i looked around the green flower temarisou: it looks like a green lawn ball.
she smiled and said, "you can get it.
by the way, it is unbelievable, the green flower temarisou is still alive!
it is a cross boarder train and i am going to work.
i had been talking about working in hong kong for quite a long time and now i make it comes true.
today is actually my second day working here and i am still on my way to adapt myself to everything in hong kong, cantonese as a new language for me and auditing as a new job for me.
i need to travel 2 hours to get to my company from my current place.
i am looking for an apartment in hong kong, however, it is not easy at all with a low income.
i need to adjust myself for it.
financial stability is my goal and i really want to achieve it.
i have to scarify something like privacy to achieve the financial stability.
i went to english meetup weekend.
i atended to this meetup at fifth times.
i talked everyone that i started to write a diary in english at lan-8.
the day, a few new members came here.
they colud speak english smoothly.
it was more than i thought.
today i had rain.
i felt a little bit hotter than any other days in this year.
pretty hard to give up sweets, to learn every day english words, to tolerate the lack of hot water, to not skip classes, to use cheap cosmetics and sincerely believe in a bright future.
today is the first spring day, but weather forecast -18c for tomorrow.
with him it is possible to talk pleasantly about your teeth and to not immediately understand that he only pretends to be interested.
in generally, the real professional.
when i was looking for a job and considering lots of companies and diffrent jobs, i did split some time to think of myself, what kind of job is good for me, what i want from a job and things like that.
but, after i started working it became clearer what i found fun and interesting throughout experiencing a lot of things with my current job.
that's pretty much all the reason.
i start to write a diary for today.
considering my lazy personality, it may be too hard to keep writing it. but i'll just keep trying it for now.
today is the first day, so it will start things want to do in this year!
to take a driver license
to go to korea
to save money
is it a correct expression?
always sleepy
i am very sleepy recently.
because it's spring?
it's getting warm from yesterday in japan.
and the powder of flower started to go everywhere.
it's effect our body especially our norse.
by the way, lang-8 moves very slow recently.
i hope it fixs soon.
today i felt a little sick.
i had a little temperature.
however i manage to work for a day.
i think i will recover tomorrow by i go to bed early today.
one of the noticeable aspects is that the high-speed railway was built to connect a golf course with business district and residential housing area situated on the right bank of the river.
another positive difference is that the business district has been increased significantly and has almost been doubled.
a comparison of the two illustrations reveals that the residential housing area on the left riverbank, as well as the recreation area, did not suffer any differences and remained unchanged.
overall, the two maps show the valuable differences occurred in the riverside town after thirty-nine years as a result of the implementation of the infrastructure program aimed to modernize the town.
i didn't learn english for about a half month, because i wanted to take a relax.
but i felt that i became some lazy these days.
so, taking a vacation is not always be a good thing.
i didn't learn english for about a half month, because i wanted to take a relax.
the mobility of foreign labor force
i realize the meaning of the figure showed.
if they had enjoyed good economy in nepal, they wouldn't have come to japan.
earning money in japan might be just one of the ways to improve their lives.
if the nepalese economy is improved, they will stay in their own country.
in fact, the number of chinese people studying or working in japan has declined these days, because the chinese economy has got better and they don't need to move out china.
moreover, other countries such as korea and thai need to get foreign workforce.
getting workforce is one of the global issues and a competition.

these days, did lang-8 have a bad connection?
opening new page takes ten seconds or more.
at first, i thought my laptop had a problem, but something's wrong.
today, it seems the situation is getting better.
"you are jokey."
"you are jokey."
it's too hard to get a job because there are too many people to work in korea.
also companies want so many things to new emploees.
korean companies want job experiences from new recruit.
what's more, even though you get a job, they say "you guys have to do more than you are paid.".
as you know, korean work so much among the oecd countries.
korean somtimes even call themselves "company's slaves".
parents will be in mandatory retirement age soon.
if they didn't make enough money, their children can be a breadwinner.
then, the economic situation will be more and more worse and the unemployed will be increase.
i'm looking forward to look at cherry blossom.
in japan, it becomes a news when cherry blossom blooms.
then, i will go a picnic with my boyfriend.
yesterday the shizuoka marathon was held.
actually the first shizuoka marathon four years ago was my first full marathon debut.
i still remember the mandarin orange i ate after finishing was so delicious.
unfortunately it was rain at that time and i ran with a raincoat at that time, but it seemed to be hot yesterday.
though it's difficult to run a race at the best because weather condition can change ease of running, it might make marathon not so simple.
by the way, yesterday there were two good things relating to running.
i ran around the aichi-ike reservoir yesterday morning and i was surprised when i checked the time after running.
amazingly, it was just 30'00''.
ironically the best thing seemed that i dropped my pace after 6 km.
when i visit a sports store casually in the afternoon, i found the running shoes asics sortie magic were sold at a discount of half-price.
they were last one and fit to my foot when i try on, and i bought them.
i think an encounter with new shoes is good thing.
i'm looking forward to enjoying the feeling when i run with them.
what is the most effective non studded winter tire?
here in japan, march is spring season.
but the area i live in is still sometimes snowfall.
and then, when i drive my car, i need to keep putting on non studded winter tires.
the question is which manufacturers of tires makes the most effective such a winter tires?
because a lot of kinds of tires exist in the world, i am puzzled which manufacturer of the tires should i chooses?
some people think that parents must not pay taxes if their children study at home or at private schools, while others believe that it is obligatory for everyone.
i am inclined to believe that despite having children or not, everyone has to pay the same amount of money in order to maintain a good level of education at public schools.
firstly, for the government, it is much easier to receive the same taxes from everyone because it is very difficult to control each family with children and where they study.
for instance, there are many families with children who have been moving from childhood from one town to another because of they just like travel.
so, how in this case to collect taxes?
more than that, children can change schools very often from a private school to a state school, and it means that in one period they have to pay, but in another period not.
secondly, the level of education of population plays a very important role not only in the social structure of a society but in the place of a country in the global arena.
in other words, each citizen must be well-educated, but not all people can allow very expensive education, and that is why it is the duty of everyone to maintain an appropriate level of education at school.
despite some people arguing that they do not care, the education must be available for everyone because it is a kind of social welfare.
thirdly, the government has to hire more employee in order to observe where children learn and collect levies from those families where children study at public schools.
consequently, the government has to bear the costs on the new staff.
your dog almost get hit by a car this morning.
that guy must live surrounded by weird people just like him.
the guy over there told you to fuck off after you gave him crap over a spot in the parking lot.
it's very pleasant to come back and see this service working.
the most amazing thing i experienced is traveling to budapest this winter.
that was a great trip full of communicating, troublesolving, visiting of plenty places, driving over the europe by car, eating local food during christmas selebrating.
i'd like to visit hungary one more time.
hi, i'm english learner.
every morning i listen english education radio and do my homework like make some sentence.
i do it hard but i'm a little bit confused that the sentence is right, did i use proper english..
so i need you help!!
the best way to stay warm in winter is staying at home!
there's no place like home.
why or why not?
i don't use it.
because i concerned about electromagnetic waves.
so i bought water mat.
basically it's same with electric mats but it use water circulation.
so i don't need to concern about electromagnetic waves.
ondol is equipped with water pipes under the floor.
and hot water circulation give off heat.
however, i think this movie is kind of overrated because i don't find anything in the movies that makes it stand out from other movies of the same genre.
the plot is set in a tribe in africa, where lots of state-of-the-art technologies overwhelmed you.

i took a day off from work today, so i was able to oversleep this morning.
it seemed that my niece forgot to buy a new notebook for her school.
this time, one notebook would solve the problem and fortunately i had a bland new one.

she needed to have a notebook which has square line for arithmetic.
some people think that if the death penalty exists, it is a responsibility of society for these killings, and subsequently, it is better to sentence the perpetrators to life in prison even in the severe crimes.
i am inclined to believe that death penalty must exist and should be applied in special cases.
firstly, in the world, there are multitude dangerous criminals, who threaten the global security.
it means that they are quite powerful and have supporters, who can help escape from a prison.
in other words, there can be a war between the special forces and terrorists for only one guy who in prison.
all these things are bought for taxes from citizens, and if the death penalty exists, these levies can be spent on other public services and goods.
however, scientists have argued that we can not kill all people who have committed a crime, it can be applied only in very severe crimes, and consequently, the institute of a prison still will fulfill its functions.
so, who had hoped that after the death penalty there would be a lot of money in state coffers, they were wrong.
some argue that it is inhuman to kill people in our modern world.
more than that, what would be, if already killed people will be recognized by the court as not guilty.
as i have said, the death penalty should exist by as a form of punishment in special cases.
today, i did almost nothing because it was raining and windy outside.
i hope it's going to be less rain tomorrow.
#01 reading-- the convenience store world by sayaka murata

he's also working for our company, but i'd never seen him at the office.
we work at other floors.

the bride looked so happy, so many people were celebrating them from the bottom of their hearts, and we had some meal and drink.
i was disappointed because i thought i could have a full-course dinner, but it was not like that.
we stood all the time and just took meal as much as we wanted.
they got married and looked happy and that made me happy, but, but, it was just disappointing.

i think parent's role is very important to children from infant to adolescence.
many people think there are 2 opinion.
one is parent's role.
the other is the environments.
people who thought parent's role is important is children is immature, dependent, irresponsibility.
so they would imitate parents.
adolescence students or defiant child  follow their instinct.
parents have obligation to raise a child as good person.
the other who thought the environments is important think the relationship with their friends or tv.
so parent can't play a role in model.
and they are interacted each other.
today, it was rainy for the first time ina while.

painkillers tablets try to don't transfer pain to your brain.

however it depends on the dose of your pain and the amount of medicine you consume.
some people like me, try to avoid to use them, because if you use them for every pain, that drug won't affect on your pain like past.
on the other hand, this way your body needs to stronger painkillers.

it is very difficult about phrases and vocablary.
i think why i have to study difficulty phrases and vocablary like the grade.

since i have to decide about what i would report, i went to library that has a lot of children's english books at hand choosing target book.

i hadn't done that for a long time.
i ate roasted beef with shampagne.
also, the manager explained about the meat and showed us how to eat.
what i do for health is just moving body regularly.
it's not hard thing like running everyday or go to gym.
i do pile a easy thing like go to the station without using transportation.
in general it seems younger don't care about their health.
it's certain the time flies so fast.
it means everybody get older so fast.
you could enjoy a certain time although, you couldn't enjoy all time unless you care about yourself.
for example, you will have own family, your wife, your sons, and you hope to be with them as long as you can.
the hope wouldn't make it unless you've been caring about your health since you are a younger.
i can imagine younger feel health sounds like.
they want to work to go up career radar and play with closed friends while they are a younger.

knowledge is power
many times we have heard from parents and teachers the phrases "knowledge is power".
what kind of power is such that it doesn't live in the muscles, heavy and strong machines?
knowledge helps people to understand the law of nature, human relationships, the world, and then use them it desire direction.
for example i i try to learn something new in addition to my school program.
i prefer to read books, watch movies, or just look for some extra information in the internet.
it helps me to be versatile and intelligent, but in my opinion, at school we should have lessons such as history, which teaches us to understand what is right and and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad, psychology, which can teach us how to communicate with people without any arguments or how to understand other people.
also we should learn how to become a successful person or how to become a leader.
i think it can be really useful, because we should know how to use our time, abilities, opportunities and information.
today it is often said that the main wealth of this century - information.

there are different many reasons that some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or other believe that success results from careful planning.
in my opinion, i believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chance because it is advantageous for us to come from taking risks or chances.
to begin with, there are a lot of social issues such as an aging society, declining population, and the recession.
with the development of technology, we are required to get special skills.
therefore, the success in life comes from taking risks and chance in modern society.
however, i was interested in sociology after i had got an economic course.
i thought that i took a chance to get both economy and sociology.
i studied many exams more than other students.
even though there were a risk to get both courses, i achieved both courses.
as a result, thanks to getting both majors, i obtained a better job.
second, there are a lot of opportunities to do if we got a risk and chance in order to be successful in our lives.
for instance, when i was a university student, i took teacher license courses.
it was very hard to take ecnomoy and sociology courses as well as teacher license course.
this was the most important to meet them in a student life.
before i met them,i was so shy that i couldn't talk with people.
i could not only learn knowledge but also have a wonderful encounter.
thus, taking a risk and chances can get a life asset.
in conclusion, i strongly believe that the success in life comes from taking a risk and chances.

in conclusion, i strongly believe that the success in life comes from taking a risk and chances.
where is the meaning of life?
i only could say that i hope to have more chances to make me go out and see the world.

it is that i'm too short of the knowledge about our society.
of course, nobody knows the society before entering the society, but i don't know the society especially.
many people study these knowledge more or less in university, but my major was welfare, so i didn't have any opportunities to touch these fields.
had you had worried about these matter before starting to work?
it's said that there are many times you feel stress nowadays.
there may be many people who are suffering from relationships at school or companies.

that's because many bonsai were exported after 1990 to overseas from japan.
q:  what kind of tournament is held?

i wonder who will carry the envelopes with the winners' name this year in the oscars.
i am not a huge fan of this event but guess i will watch a bit of the ceremony.
do you remember the mistake in the oscars of the last year?
in that time the organizers said that the couple who used to carried the envelopes with the winners' name will be fired.
i remember they both were workers of accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers.
in the ceremony of the last year the couple of presenters made a mistake and they named to "la la land" as the winner of best movie, but they were given the wrong envelopes and instead of saying that "moonlight" was the winner as best movie, the presenters told that "la la land" was the winner.
it was embarrassing to see the casting of la la land on the stage accepting that they were not the winners but moonlight was the winner.
i wonder who did carry the envelopes with the winners' name this year.
maybe the couple of the last year actually was fired.
until this moment i have not read anything about that.

way to my goals.
i am from russia but now i'm living in vienna in austria and studi at the university.
pass an international englisch exam with level b2-c1 until 1.
pass an international german exam with level c1 until 1.
the additional goals:
get a job-offer
i would write here what i made to achieve my goals every day.
if you have some recommendation how i can achieve my goals, just write here.
in many families, it has been traditional for them to choose their children's professions, while in other families children choose their future career by themselves.
i can see advantages in both situations, however, i am inclined to believe that future profession should depend on children's choice.
on the one hand, choosing the future career by children has a myriad of advantages.
if teenagers choose what they really want to do, there will like their job and be quite successful.
for instance, if a child has been really passionate about design since childhood, parents must not dissuade him from doing this thing.
more than that, they have to contribute a lot so as to this job will give him success, attraction and a fell of his place in life.
on the other hand, sometimes it is good to listen advises of your parents because they have a long experience in life, and that is why their suggestions may be quite useful.
for example, my good friend had hoped on their parents, but his results were not successful.
and as a result of a wrong choice, he can be casually employed, stressful, cold front, subsequently, some people decide to enroll at university once more but on their favorite subject.
to sum up, despite some people think it is better to follow parents advises, others may argue that children must have a choice and choose themselves their future life.
as i have written, it is better to let children pick up something out and only sometimes draw attention to advise from parents.
on the friday night, i met up with my friends, and went to izakaya to drink.
after that, we went around some places to drink and karaoke.

a foreign body approaching the earth soon
a sub-planet called 2017vr12 whose diameter is 488 meters will pass over the earth at dawn of march 7th, according to newsweek.
the nasa classified it as a possibly dangerous object.
however, the distance between it and the earth doesn't exceed 1.4 billions of kilometers - the safe and enough near length for people to watch it through a house-telescope.
although to calculate how big a sub-planet is from a far distance is very difficult, researchers can do this.
they can predict its size upon measuring its light intensity but this method can result in a big error.
as consideration for an object small but very bright, its lightness can be the same as that of a bigger one.
some people think that life in the 21st century is easier, more innovative than it was about 100 years ago, while others may suppose that their ancestors were living better than now because they did not know about some global problems, should not check their email each hour or just simply they used to live for themselves, in their own pace.
however, i am inclined to believe that nowadays life has introduced a lot of innovation and discoveries.
it is more exciting to live now because we can develop in different ways, know lots of things and think broader.
firstly, a modern life has introduced a myriad of innovations in our everyday life, consequently, it has become easier to live.
for instance, we can use the internet so as to communicate with friends or siblings or use search engines to find a necessary information.
we should not spend time on cooking or go to the movie because of all of them we can do through the internet.
moreover, other gadgets like smartphones or appliances make our life easier.
another development is transport systems because we can very fast travel from one country to another.
however, all these innovation cause global problems like global warming, pollutions, and other major issues, but with such developments in technologies, people will overcome these problems in the near future.
secondly, now we still getting used to a myriad of professions.
for instance, 100 years ago people did not have the same amount of occupations, but since that time, technologies have been developing and now we have professions like vr designers or developers of artificial intelligence and so on.
in other words, people whole lived several decades ago, just did not imagine such professions.
more than that, now we can receive more knowledge than it was accessible a century ago and know a lof thing about the space, our planet and so.
all of it improves people's ability to think broader, subsequently, people think more global than our ancestors who thought mainly about their own problems.
to sum up, despite some people believe that life was better a century ago, others believe that now it is easier and better.
i agree with the latter opinion because the world has become more interconnected, that is why it is more interesting to live nowadays.

today went for a walk and noticed two youth gangs standing in front of each other and watching two guys fighting in the center.
it was afternoon and nobody was giving a slightest sh..
some passer-by stopped for a moment to get a better look but none of them called police or something.
by the time i walked out of the shop on another side of the street both gangs disappeared.
on this picture two armies standing in front of each other watching two warriors fighting.
i read somewhere that this is a very ancient thing which originate from our ancestors.

i moved my working desk to the other building last week.
from this week, i work in the building.
since the building has many companies, many people stand in long lines in front of elevators every morning.
to arrive earlier, i need to take the train 15 minutes prior to the one i was taking until last week.
although i need to leave my house earlier, the time i'm in the train becomes shorter than last one.
it is good for me and for my back because the stress gotten on my back gets lighter.
however, the time i can study english becomes shorter than before.
this movement was good or bad.
when i attended a it conference in the past and listened to the speech by mark jarvis,oracle chief marketing officer then, he gave the audience an anecdote of top it manager and a genie:
the genie declines because it's above his ability.
i want to get maximum customer satisfaction ever." to this, the genie says, "well, how many rains do you want on a bridge."
that seemed like a punch line and the audience laughed without me.
most japanese speakers cannot discern the "l" sound and "r" sound clearly as they are listening to english speech.

there are a lot of discussion about english education now in japan.
entrance examinations for university have been very difficult and complex whose text is russel's essay,for example.
however, world has become much smaller place these days and global communication is needed, so some officers, politicians and english teachers assert that students must study more speaking skills.
according to the mlit, many people move in march and april because of their company transfers or entrance universities.
the reason for the lack is because increasing online shoppers makes the transportation companies busy.
the minister of mlit, ishii, commented that he was afraid it might be impossible for people to move whenever they want to do.
japan trucking association is handing out the brochure that asks the people who plan the moving to change the date to less congested days on the streets.

while some people think that all pulis must have classes in a foreign language since the earliest grades, others may argue that a foreign language is only an option and if children do no wat study a foreign language, it should not be obligatory for them.
for instance, despite the un is an international organization, it requires knowing two languages: english and french, without them you can not be an employee there.
bi-lingual people can go to work to another country and read and write documents in another language, or they can continue their academic career after school and enroll at a university in another country.
people who know another language can communicate with people or find a lot of friends in others countries.
in other words, they can be familiar with a myriad of cultures, traditions and be kind of a citizen of the world.
secondly, studying a foreign language improves children's ability to think more creatively and deeper.
in other words, they used to listen and see familiar words, however with time their brain get used to new vocabulary.
to sum up, there is an opinion that for teenagers language classes should be studying since childhood.
as i have written, i agree with this opinion because of it has a lot of advantages in their future and it develops their ability to think.
no one told you that you had your fly down.
if somebody would've told you that you had your fly down, you had taken care of it.

if somebody would've told you that you had your fly down, you had closed it.

this is preparation for ielts part 2.
i wrote script for speaking.
the language other than english that you would like to learn
it is french language that i would like to study.
french language is the second most popular language in japan.
the location where french language is spoken of course include france and some other african countries like senegal where many people who study french visit to learn it as it don't cost as much as in france.
the difficulty i assume in french is that comprehension to listen french, french language is spoken so fast and liaison occur so many time.
these makes me difficult understand what is spoken in french.
on the other hand, the easy things is that french grammar is similar to english grammar.
this enable me to learn french easily as it is able to compare french with english.
the reason why i would like to study french is that i would like to study in france in near future.
currently, i came to be interested in artificial intelligence and considering to enter a university.
in france, tuition fee is almost free to gather competent students from all over the world.

there were some waves against such amendment on the internet.
a seemingly knowledgeable person explained the logical behind that: president xi has to continue his terms when they are over because the anti xi power has not been loyally annihilated yet, once he leaves his position as president, they will step in, causing upraising and unrest.
this amendment is temporary, and it will revert to its former way when the right moment comes.
president trump even showed his support, calling xi is a good man, and saying america should give it a shot one day.
he might be the second man who will have continued his terms until he dies after mao.

everyone might like to forget many days of their life.
to me, the day i gave a speech at my age 25 is still contorting me.
i gave a lot of thought about how i can give a good impression to other people for many days.
but i made a huge mistake.
i changed my script before the day i give the speech.
sometimes, the thin line that divides reality from fiction becomes blurred and makes the way for such incredible stories as the one i'm about to tell you in the following paragraphs.
the last rays of sunlight were giving way to night when the old turtle that was calmly floating on its trunk, heard an unusual sound coming from the sky.
right there appeared two flying toads each of them on a lily pad.
the sky was full as if it were a rain of toads.
not even the rest of the animals seemed to understand what was happening there.
all of them were identical: huge, fat, brownish-green stained with spots skin, bulging eyes that seemed to look nowhere and with a big smile of satisfaction in the face that gave them an almost martian appearance.
the moonlight illuminated a sky full of flying toads that broke into the houses taking advantage of any gap.
at 4.38 am or so, just before the break of day began, all the toads flew aimlessly as if disoriented, as afraid that the morning sun would discover them flying in the sky outside their pond, until they found a dog that without saying a word, began to guide them to the place where it thought they belong to.
later on with the first rays of light, the smile of the toads wiped when discovered that the sun made the magic wear off and the water lily leaves stopped flying, falling in a nosedive into the pond as if it were a biblical plague.
next tuesday at the same time, the last rays of the day seemed to project on the wall of an old barn what looked like...

economic growth and environmental degradation have been two terms in the sense sentence for a long time.
developments in technology have brought various environmental problems.
some believe that people need to live simpler lives to solve environmental problems.
in my opinion, technology has a big role in sustainable development.
living a simple life is a way to solve environmental problems, but we must be honest, everybody uses technology in your daily life.
also, many industries depend on developments in technology, such as manufactory, communications, energy, international commerce, and so forth.
on the other hand, there are a bunch of initiatives and project reaches that could help to solve these problems.
for example, there are many studies related to alternative energy sources like solar energy, wind energy, biomass energy, etc.
this kind of projects could reduce the use of fossil fuels.
additionally, many findings show good results in inventions such as electric and automated cars, systems of recycling and reuse, advanced biorefinery, the list is so long.
today, i'll write about what i've been thinking about my job.
there are some reasons why i think about that.
one is that the food industly is so stable that pretty much no one quite their job or move to a different company.
because of that, the average age of the employees is very old.
i respect my coworkers who work hard and always make a good performance, but on the other hands it's not stimulating and inspiring.
i should have done more research on this before joing the company but you'll never know what it would be like until you actually become a part of it.

preston garvey is also one of player's companions, so you can go adventuring with him once you allies with him.
he becomes useless even more than a randomly spawned settler.
preston garvey is also one of player's companions, so you can go adventuring with him once you allies with him.
after that point, preston gets furious and disappointed in you, so you can't interact with him as a companion anymore.
that makes sense how he reacts in that situation, but as a player, i thought, "i just did that to simply enjoy the dlc!

3 months have passed since i moved to boston from california.
it is popular to run along the charles river which runs in the center of boston to all the way west, and i often run there too.
there is a nice trail both sides of river.
you can see many runners anytime of the day even in snow storm days.
on weekday after work, i only run 3 miles along the river, but literally i see more than 50 runners during runs.
it is encouraging to see a lot of runners, both serious and casual runners.
in california, there are many runners, but it is much less likely to see runners on even a drizzling day.
soon boston marathon will be held.
i am excited about seeing all the elite runners from all over the world.
when i read a juvenile story called "holes" in the past, one of the characters has a nickname of "x-ray." i was intrigued by the fact that this name of x-ray was a product of game called pig latin.
i didn't know about pig latin before.
there is also a language game like pig latin in japanese.
therefore, japanese pig latin is far more simpler than english one: remove the last sound from the word and put it at the beginning.
however, speakers of japanese may think of the combination of a consonant and a vowel as one sound and you don't aware specific consonants consciously.
therefore, japanese pig latin is far more simpler than english one: remove the last sound from the word and put it at the beginning.
by the way, i think "holes" is very intriguing, interesting well-made story and i recommend this to ones who didn't read it yet.
i make it a rule not to eat between meals and to exercise at least three times a week.
what is the most effective method to succeed in a diet.
recently, i started the diet.
so, there is this guy i know from work, he`s mexican, jose is his name.
too funny, he came from a city or a village with the longest name, guadalupa, guantaladupa, the fuck i know.
when he joined us at the farm he was the worst, he had no clue about how the work is get done and also was the laziest of the guy, you know?
most of my job consists in walking through them with a watchnwhile they`re picking up, and to pretend i`m take the time.
ehy, i`m not sayin` they`re saints or whatever you wanna call`em, i am not saying that.
they take of their interests all right, you know what i mean?
if they hire mexicans they do for the money they spare all right.
it is what it is.
an early morning i found him around a corner smoking good stuff.
- ehy yo motherfucka, what are you doin`?
you betcha go to work now- the motherfucka glared at me smiling and started moving his ass.
-hey come here jose- i said -what are you smokin` at?- i took the dark cigarette from his fingers and took some drag.
so since that day, every day before work we have been smoking marijuana every morning before work.
i even chipped in a couple of time with good money.
-but i am your boss, remember-.
we changed the place where to do it `cause we don`t want to get caught.
-so jose- i used to mock him -who is your boss?- one time this lazy guy gave me an answer i can`t still wrap my head around.
he said -you ain`t no my boss.
you ain`t none boss around here, man.
you don`t have the words.- what the fuck he meant i `ll never know.
i am italian all right, i came here with a better english than everybody around here and this motherfucka told me i have no words.
-go to work motherfucka- i said.
he kept the cigarette around his fingers for a while then put it out and left.
i don`t have the words.
see, i am not against immigration, i am not even against illegals to be honest.
they do their job all right, i guess.
americans need to do other stuff if they wanna pay mortgage.
i kinda recognize we need them.
but if you legalize motherfukers like this, they would learn some english and pretend do have better job than we have.
in ten years we are screwed.
i mean, they need to pay their dues as everybody`d else, is that clear all right?
the wall, well the wall is all good, it is pure gold.
because they will understand we don`t want them here all right, they will keep in mind who`s the boss `round here motherfuckers.
you hear that all right.
jose was neither good nor bad, to be honest.
he worked, minded his own business, earned his 3 dollars per hours, and went home after sunset like everybody else.
only in the morning, we had our little affair with the a little marjiuana all right.
this morning he isn`t there.
fuck jose, where the hell are you?!
it makes me works, zero thoughts, work`s good, silence in mind and mind to the job.
i see these two guys comin` towards me, juan and pedro, their names.
they`re kids all right.
-hey fellows, where the hell is jose?
you know that all right?
-they look at me speechless, there is something wrong, i`m italian for christ`s sake and i know what i am saying.
-what`s wrong with you guys?
i am going now to tell the boss if you don`t rat him out all right, right here, right now- i want to sound intimidatory and caught them by surprise so they couldn`t resist me and confess.
but they are making that much resistance.
the sun blinds me through the sunglasses.
they move fast enough between the rows picking up, picking up.
they follow a kinda rhythm, nobody is too slow nobody is fast or hectic.
even girls work here sometime.
we reach a place where everybody gather to drink some water but i can`t stop, if i stop i faint, if i stop i am done.
it is on open space between two plantations, it is just 20 feet large.
-well?- i say.
and the two guys, pedro and the other say -here`s jose, senor-.
i kinda figure it out better now.
there is this tomatoes plant, very well kept, of a good red and ready to be picked.
-we shall pick him up?- ask the two guys a little confused.
-the hell i know - i say-i have to ask my boss-
after finish my work today, i'll have day off tomorrow.
so i'll do my best to finishing my work today, but it'll rainy tomorrow, so i'm sad.
anyway, i want to go fun time today.

some people say the government should not put money into building theatres and sports stadiums; they should spend more money on medical care and education.
some people think authorities should spend more money in medical care and education instead of investing money in building theatres and sport stadiums.
even though medical care and education are vital for all us, they are not the only things determining the welfare of human beings.
first of all, we should consider that the activities performed at theatres and sport stadiums contribute not only to our physical health but also to our mental health.
it is evident that sports require physical activity that helps us maintain our bodies in a good condition.
but it has been scientifically proved that practicing sports also promotes mental health.
it is also healthy to stimulate our brains by attending artistic activities, watching theatre plays would be one of those activities.
secondly, activities like sports and art allow people exploring their minds.
all things considered, governments should include education, medical care, sports as well as entertainment in the budget of a nation, giving of course, the highest amount of money to the areas that are priority to the society.
i seldom go business trip now, but i had gone business trip to hirosaki-city, aomori-prefecture almost every week 10 years ago for the monitoring of clinical study site.

do you think that the students' council should have a voice in deciding about the future of the university of warsaw in cooperation with the university officials?
university of warsaw is an institute where very a lot of students spend most time.
the biggest part in that university are students but all decisions about universities always make the university officials.
is it right or maybe students' council should gave a voice as well?
as part of the university officials, they come people who were studying before, who has experience and for who the most important are students because students create all society at university of warsaw.
they know also the history and needing of students the most so anyone should impose new things.
on the other hand, the students are people who are also mature people and also they want to create good place where they are studying and new young people will be studying as well.

it is gils' day.
hinamarsuri is a day to pray for the health and happiness of young girls.
for more variety, sometimes we change the decoration of the place we live.
for doing this, having a big house will be easier than a small home, because a small flat doesn't have enough place to change everything.
therefore you need to think more about every changing.
for changing a decoration, don't need to buy any new stuff.
only, try to show your creativity for making a new design for your rooms, halls an so on.
as a result, do every change that make your space more enjoyable for yourself not others.
boomerang by michael lewis review
my impression of this book is still fresh as i read it on the last week.
author tells about how several developed countries behave as if they were the third world countries.
he makes it with sense of humour and in easy language.
there are 5 chapters, each of which two one if the following countries - island, greece, ireland, german, the usa.
island is a waterlocked state, which population is about 300 000 people.
the interesting things started happen when they find new industry to develop.
that was investment banking industry.
despite the fact that there were a few people who understand something in finance, this idea became wide spread.
normally, there three approach to invest money.
the course of your stocks is also growing fast.
you hold your stocks till the moment when you earn enough, and decide to get into the cache.
you buy a large part of stocks of a company in a poor state, and improve its performance.
their market capitalisation is growing up after that, you get into cache.
there are few people who possesses this knowledge in island.
they invest plenty of borrowed cheap money in companies outside of the country without appropriate knowledge.
the borrowings became too big even in country level and the bad quality of debts revealed.
the course of local currency went down.
taking into account that all the debts were in yen and swiss francs, people are all in debts.
they need to pay 3 times more for the current property.
for instance, they need 100 k usd to pay off a car that costs 30 k usd.
some people expect to live happy in heaven and some people believe in next life.
however, first of all, we should make this world peaceful for ourselves and next generations.
however, this seems to be the same with us.
we should not punish others but live with others.
the nice two room apartment is located diagonally opposite the main canteen.
we have a beautiful kitchen with a dishwasher and a dining table, where we can meet, cook and talk.
your room is 12 m2 big and has a nice green view from the window.
many shopping possibilities and good connection to the city center are also available.
the room has any furniture and the walls of your future room were painted white by my room mate one years ago.
in 100m from our house is a large park, where you can jog, barbecue or just chill with friends.
there are also in the immediate vicinity a river, beach and a sports center of the university.
in that case you can keep the apartment if you want.
watch out!!!

if our situations are not looking so good, we should admit it first.

why isn't it so?" we should just admit our bad situation and start to look for the way to solve it.

as the general of minuteman, the player thinks "why don't you go helping them yourself before asking me!?"
he calls the protagonists "general", but makes the players feel like an errand boy.
so his repeated lines get their the nerves and many of them end up hating him.

just before moving out, she writes down a few words on a small piece of paper that she folds in four, and then she slips it into a slot of a wall.
he does not really want to move out, but m is determined to live in town and she is already packing her stuff.

the diagram shows two big sorts of processes.
first, at the left, we have those having to do with the manufacturing of the product itself; secondly, at the right side, processes related to conceptual aspects.
above, we can see how based on raw material and manufactured components go through storage stage, then production planning take place and it needs design as well as sales feedback, following there the processes of assembly, inspection, and testing, the latter step give feedback to the design stage.
once testing has been done, packaging stage takes place and it requires information from market research, once packaging is completed dispatch and sales take place.

in any language, there is a large difference between general expressions and frankly expressions.
so learners of foreign language are confused by how native speakers actual talk.
in nowadays times, the advances that technology has achieved have led to change the way people communicate with each other.
for some people the current functioning of communication implies that writing letters will not be necessary anymore.
besides, our message may be as long as we want, and we may attach all kind of files, including images, video as well as other countless kind of formats.
writing on computers, tablets or any other electronic device allows addressing multiple persons at the same time.
when we need to give the same message to several people we only need to copy and paste the text and by doing that, we will save ourselves a lot of time.
on the other hand, writing letters in the traditional way, by using a sheet of paper and making the effort to handwrite whatever message, conveys an especial feeling.
so, whenever we want to let someone know how much that person mean for us, writing a letter will make the difference, as simple as it might appear, it is a great way to give a message to someone special.
however, i do not think writing letters is meant to disappear.

i don't mean to go back early every day because i'm just a one of employees so i'm not eligible to whine like that.
obviously, there are tons of workers who get out of later than me, should think i'm not working in a bad environment.
a piece of advise
when we give correction or comment, it will be need to give a link, for instance on wikipedia.
it is possible just to copy your browser address bar and to insert it your entry or comment.
sometimes, it could look as here:
in this case, you can do it in two stages.
first insert content before the lust slash
and then insert a rest
it must look as here
if_a_content_include_some_macrons, a link could not work, but whatever it look better.
i think the best hospitality is to give first priority to customer.
for example, in the lunch box shop, if customer have many short bags, lunch box staff prepared for a big bag and the staff together short bag.
if so, it is easy for customer to carry bag.

there's a peak called "angels landing" which i had wanted to climb during my life.
from the trailhead i ascended moderately strenuous switchbacks in an hour and reached a point called scout lookout.
most hikers seemed to enjoy the view from there and then double back to the trailhead while the rests set out to the summit push including me.
after scout lookout, the last half mile of the trail got more strenuous and went through the ridge like godzilla's dorsal fin.
therefore, it has been called one of the most dangerous hiking courses in the world and it's not for those who have the fear for height.
however, there were chains for grip all along the trail, so i didn't have to feel tremendous fear until the summit.
the view during the trail and from the summit were the most stunning things in my life.

i sent an email with the link to my soundcloud account to one of my cowkers, coming out that i've been posting recordings of my singing there, asking her if she could listen to them and give me some feedbacks.
she told me once before that she used to belong to a courus club when she was a student, and i always wanted her to give me some comments on my singing since i assumed she knew about singing much more than i.
but right after i clicked the send button, i kind of freaked out about what i've just done.

as far as i know, global warming is one of the most common topics in many english tests, because it's safe topic to talk about.
yesterday, my english teacher gave me a topic "north korea can be your good neighbor." i guess most of people have similar opinion about it, and this kind of political questions are unlikely to be given in the international exam.
i wonder if there is anything i can talk about global warming.
same as majority of people, i believe scientists, it is not chinese conspiracy.

i remember once, when i was eight years old, as i walked down a lonely street, an old and stranger woman came up to me and greeted me.
i really remember there was something very strange about that woman - in her face, her voice, her posture.
in fact, thinking about it carefully, i think maybe she wasn't a real woman because her features were rough.
the point is that there was something bothering me quite a bit so i forgot all about the kindness and ran desperately until i got home.
being at my house, i told my mother what happened, but i don't think she took it very seriously because she told me that i had exaggerated things or something like that.
the creepiest thing was that, as my classmates said, the child had been seen, for the last time, hugging a strange old woman and walking away with her.
tell me the recipe of the coconut milk
i asked my kenyan friend if she has cooked with coconut milk or not.

however, i disagree that all students should be required to study art and music in secondary because it is not advantageous for all students to study art and music in secondary school.
to begin with, we study many subjects such as math, chemical, and history when we were a student.
with the economic change, we are required to a special skills and ability to get a better job.
also, an academic background is very important to be promoted to our career.
therefore, it is not essential to learn art and music in secondary school.
for example, when i was a high school student, i got an exam to enroll in a high school.
no one needed to study art and music to go to a high school.
with the development of the internet, we can learn these subjects using the online course.
in addition, we can learn art and music at club activity in a school.
for instance, when i was a high school student, one of my friends made a music club activity at a school.
he gathered some friends in order to enjoy playing the music.
after graduating from a high school, he tried to be a professional guitar player.
thus, we can study art or music on our own instead of taking a course.

i read these words a few years ago and each time i find something new in them.
i hope i have done enough justice to its author, to whom all my admiration is dedicated.
i know how much you like to hear it said - but i do not write it just for this reason: i do so because writing to you warms my heart.
so much time has passed since i last wrote to you, almost two years, but i know you will forgive me because you know how i am, stubborn and realistic, and i thought that writing made no sense.
but now, my darling wife, i know i have to do what i have always delayed and have done so often in the past.
i find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you now that you are dead, but i still want to comfort you and take care of you, and just as i want you to love me and take care of me.
i want to deal with the problems with you, i want to do little projects with you.
i never thought we could do such a thing until now.
thinking of us.
we started to learn to make clothes together, learning chinese, using a movie projector.
can't i do that now?
i am alone without you: you were my "ideal woman" and the instigator of all our crazy adventures.
this is the letter that richard wrote to the love of his life: arline.
i read these words a few years ago and each time i find something new in them.

so much time has passed since i last wrote to you, almost two years, but i know you will forgive me because you know how i am, stubborn and realistic, and i thought that writing made no sense.
when you got sick, you were worried because you could not give me certain things that you believed i needed.
and now this is even more true: you can't give me anything, yet i love you so much that i couldn't love any other woman - nor would i love it.
but you can't do anything about it, my darling, and neither do i.
i don't understand: i met several girls, even cute girls, and i don't want to remain alone, but after two or three meetings they do not stimulate me to continue the relationship.
in the post scriptum, there is all the author.
he uses irony almost as if he wants to confine the pain of his loss, accepting the presence of his wife in a dimension that he himself does not conceive.

i know that you will blame me that i am foolish and that you want to see me fully happy and don't want to be an obstacle for me.
i don't understand: i met several girls, even cute girls, and i don't want to remain alone, but after two or three meetings they do not stimulate me to continue the relationship.
it costs much money.
the first time i heard of it is when i was talking with my indonesian friend on a skype call and he asked me whether i know this under-construction building.
however, i was really embarrassed since i didn't know about it.
you know that i'm not a knowledgeable person.
but later on, i saw it on a post by asean skyline and noticed that it was the one i had been asked about.
that post gave me some amazing information about landmark 81, one of the top tallest buildings in southeast asia called "the great wall of saigon" by asean skyline.
but the most surprising thing i got that day is that the unknown building i had been asked about is exactly the one i see every day on the way to school.
and it was which i was wondering about how tall it is in comparison with bitexco tower.
though i do know that vietnam is nothing at all in terms of high-rise buildings, i was kind of proud when i knew that a vietnam building will be one of the top tallest buildings in the sea.
today's diary
today's event
i wrote diary in english on my notebook until yesterday but i wonder my english expression is correct so i've decided to use lang-8.
my manager advised me that the target time to finish it is within 2 hours so try it keeping in my mind.
making a quote is so difficult for me because of my lack knowledge of car parts that i thought i study about it more.
thank you for your concern me and talk to me, my kind 2 boss.
i never try to choose kimonos that contain gold powder, also embroidered kimono, hand- painted and crepe de chine.
getting wet can cause problems as shrinkage and loss of colour a lot!
i love cotton kimonos but they loss of colours for water easily.
i recommend that you wash them with water contains salt and clear vinegar.
you can prevent that with such problem.
besides bayonetta 3 and octopath--whose relase date are still unknow--i have no interest in any released switch titles.
i really hope nintendo could keep the momentum and release more aaa games in 2017.

my last diary is written several years ago.
i often simulate original model of fluid dynamics by using "python".
python means programming language, which is familiar with beginner.
this building is called "gojyunotou".
that means a 5-storied tower.
there are many sculptures shaping the chinese zodiac on its wall.
normally, the order is the following in the accordance with chinese zodiac story.
however, firstly tiger, secondly rabbit and thirdly dragon...
, this order.
why isn't is normal order?
gojyunotou was built by tokugawa iemitsu and his signs of chinese zodiac is dragon.
his grandfather's one is tiger and father's one is rabbit.
that's why such a weird order.
at the beginning of the lesson, my teacher offered me a chocolate cookie which is my favourite.
he told me that he also liked it, so he wanted to eat pillow sized of this chocolate.
of course there was no such big sized chocolate cookies.
or i should write a letter to the cookie company that whether or not they listen to our requests to make our ideal chocolate cookies.
i topped some chopped green onions and egg on the beef.
even though it was carbohydrate and not good for my diet, the sukiyaki was tasty.
since my wife and i were very tired, we decided to buy sukiyaki bento for dinner.
i topped some chopped green onions and egg on the beef.
it was very strong wind today.
if you could cry on anyone's shoulder,whose would it be?
he is trustworthy because he listens to my talk sincerely and gives me good advise.

i'm planning to visit europe in this spring.
i'm not sure i'll be able to take my vacation though.
i'd like to take a night train in travel.
in japan, night trains disappear one after another this decade.
as a result, they are in service only on new year holidays.
i've heard that there are many long-distance train line in europe.
that is one of the reasons why i want to travel europe.
french, finland, hungary, switzerland,...

the trouble is i should know its turn.
i think it is stye.
i sometimes get such symptoms when i get tired.
how many times should i apply the medicine to my eyes a day?

i watched the greatest showman today
it was really nice and gave me important things.
like i went through the life of the greatest showman.
and then back to my life, i can think my life in different way.
it is what i need.
additionally the songs were absolutely great.
i already bought the soundtracks.
fiy.
we can take discount movies services on 1st day in japan.
funny dialogues
because you are an asian."
i laughed again.
maybe i should take some time improving fluency while ignoring all grammatical errors and accuracy.
if i can't say anything for a minute because i concern too much about grammar and worry if i am wrong, the opponent who is waiting for my words will be very tried and frustrated.
i don't have to speak like native ones now.
i just have written it down in a row without self correction to practice it.
but i think it's okay, at least now.
"i'm going to pig out tonight!" means "i'm going to eat too much!" my english teacher told us at the lesson.
he often teaches un some useful phrases.
maybe this is the reason why the united states is great.
american freedom, democracy, human rights, i do not think it is advantages.
most chinese people have not seen a american in whole life, it is regrettable.
i took a paid holiday yesterday.
i went to karaoke by myself and practiced english songs.
then i went to dermatology and got treatment for my face.
i actually had many pimples on my face and it had been made me so depressed everyday.
now i have less but still there are many craters on my face.
accurately i take a laser treatment and injection treatment.
before taking them, i apply anesthetic on my face and just wait until it works.
then i take laser.
after this my face gets so red.
so i wear mask and go back to my flat hoping nobody see my face.
i think my skin has got better than before but i still feel insecure in front of people in a blight room where my skin reflect the light and craters stand out.
do you know some websites or language course to learn english, which use "point of view" short story?
i know grammar, but i want to bring it to life and start to use it correctly, without thinking every time when i need them about grammar rule.
in point of view short story the point is that: the same short story are write in a few version.
every version of short story is told in different time.
it helps me a lot to better remember rules, but i find only a few that kind of short story in web.
or maybe you know better way to master them?
i heard an interesting story about bitcoin.
a famous japanese comedian was asked to buy ten coins for 1000 dollar by an acquaintance.
the coins are plated with golden color and carved a letter "b" on the surface.
he said these are bitcoin.
he said to the comedian that bitcoin would rise certainly and the comedian knew bitcoin was popular.
so the comedian bought them for 1000 dollar.
if you notice it is strange, it means you know well about bitcoin.
because bitcoin is virtual currency, so they don't exist as real coin.
the comedian knew that after he bought them and noticed that he was deceived.
do you laugh at him?
or might you be deceived like him?
i'm just in the spring vacation.
i do part time jobs and stay home all day recently.
mostly i stay home and watch movies, read books, see twitter, and sleep.

nowadays, many children are busy with school, homework, and other duties, that is why they do not have enough time to go out each day and just enjoy the sunshine or fresh air.
i am inclined to believe that they can not develop well without understanding the natural environment, activities on the fresh air, real knowledge why we must protect our environment and so on.
they have to go out, go each day several kilometers, breathe with the fresh air or do sports activities.
if people do not do it, consequently, it leads to the lack of health and some problems with health.
when they become adolescents, they enroll in university, as a result, they will have less time for such activities or just forget about them.
the main trend here is that if they did not such a habit since childhood, with age they will not do it at all.
secondly, when children play out, they can know the world by playing in the park or with animals.
they are in the natural environment, subsequently, it develops their curiosity because they see a myriad of unknown thing which they will want to know.
with time, they will understand that the environment plays a crucial role in our life, that is why we should protect it.
in the future, this generation will be aware of environmental problems and will try to solve it faster and more professionally.
to sum up, children are very busy with their everyday activities and can spend their time on the environment, as a result, it leads to some problems with age, like a lack of mental agility or health problems.

the small cars are restricted the size and the power of engine, however the owners of the small cars can revive a lot of benefits.
for example the high way fee and the car insurance rate and the car tax will be offed at discounted price for the owners.
except for above mentioned benefits.
the owners can reduce running cost of the cars.
the small car is more light than other car models.
they can drive effectively on long way.
replacing tires cost
the owner have to replace their car tiers periodically, and it is a burden for owners.

the diagram below illustrates us about the functioning of a central heating system and how it works in a house.
firstly, we can see on the top on the figure the water tank to fill the storage tank, it receives the cold water that enters into the house and then provides the storage tank.
this simple system known as central heating system provides homes with hot water by using the cold water entering into the house.
there is a pipeline distributed all over the house, this pipeline along with the pump allow transporting the water to the different places in the house.
before the hot water get to the hot water taps and hot water radiators for final usage in bathrooms and kitchens inside the house, it has to go to the boiler, which can work with either gas or oil.

nuclear technology has given the national authorities the power to harm the world we live in.
on the other hand nuclear technology has been shown to have positive applications like electric energy production.
in my opinion nuclear energy can be as harmful as man wants so.
even though atomic bombs can dramatically affect the population, it is not the only application nuclear energy can be used for.
same thing happens with nuclear energy, it has good and bad applications, then it depends on human race to make responsible decisions on how to use technologies such as nuclear energy.
nuclear energy produces big amounts of energy in a more efficient way than hydroelectric or wind power plants can.
in conclusion, nuclear technology is potentially dangerous to our lives to the extent man wants so.
it is up to governments, authorities, and us all as a society to make sure to wisely use the resources we count on in the current times.
yet the technology has been put to positive use as an energy source and in certain areas of medicine.

a fortnight ago, a gun shooting rampage happened at a school in america.
just after the tragedy, mr trump insisted that the more teachers held a gun at school, the safer students would become.

irritating, finally the friend plots to set the dogs on dr-f.
the dog, being set free, runs to dr-f and begins to bark at him.
the robot doesn't do anything but to run around with dr-f, trying to get out of the dog.
seeing this from his hiding place and feeling fed up, the friend thinks, "what a nonsense he made," and gives up his research.
dr-f returns to his home in the evening and before going to bed at night, he gives an order to his robot, "go ahead."
the robot begins his work for a while: sits at the desk, takes out the notebook, and writes in dr-f's diary, "lost my handkerchief while out for a walk.
barked by a dog and narrowly escaped, and so on..."

enjoy every moment of life without comparing it to anyone.
try to take interest in the small things you do either for yourself or other.
if you keep comparing your life with others, you will never be happy.
you will have to live an unhappy and unhealthy life in doing so.

i downloaded a curling game on my smartphone during the olympic games were held.
i have played real curling once before but i didn't know the rule at all, so it was like just an imitating.
i learned a bit about the rule as i watched this olympic curling games.
anyway, this smartphone game was so addictive that i can't stop playing on my free time.
i think the opponent is also the people who downloaded from all over the world.
so sometime they were very bad and sometime they quit as they know that they will lose, so watching opponents is also fun.
i bet i am also laughed at because i'm terrible player, too.
the other day, i really wanted to just enjoy a movie without any bother, so i went to movies alone.
the guy who sat at my back kept kicking my seat whenever he burst his laughing at funny scenes.
all seats around me was so packed, that i couldn't change the seat and i just tried to put up with him by thinking that he unconsciously was reacting to a movie.
when my patient was at last worn out, i just looked at him again without any word, finally he stopped kicking my seat.
we tattemped to persuade them to participate in an explanatory meeting to be held on monday.

they are going to invite him to their office because people there make much money.
it seems, we should be happier than our ancestors because many of us only read or hear about wars, famine and many other unpleasant things.
however, a global level of unhappiness is still high.
maybe, it is impossible to find universal pieces of advice, which can help everyone to be happier.
nevertheless, i want to tell about some personal tips of mine.
our brain concentrates on exercises, we become healthier and more attractive and we can have extra energy to do something.
having regular sport trainings is much easier than many people imagine.
we should just find time, choose the best suitable kind of sport and start going to a gym or to a sport studio at least 2-3 times per week.
i like dancing and go to bachata classes because it is sport, fun and a great linguistic and psychological practice for me.
my best friends live in another country but even an opportunity to listen to their voices or laugh at their jokes always brings fun in my life.
a good book can be the same as useful as a good friend.
it gives us important information, entertain us and make us more cheerful or creative.
for me it is a book about super power of an ordinary man, which always inspires me to see life brighter and achieve my goals more persistently.
it matters, if we want to be happier.
some personal tips to be happier
one of the main psychological problems of modern society is loss of ability to be happy.
having regular sport trainings is much easier than many people imagine.
we should just find time, choose the best suitable kind of sport and start going to a gym or to a sport studio at least 2-3 times per week.
secondly, i think, we should talk to our friends as often as possible to be happier.
we should just call our best friends, speak to them and think about the best thing possible to have together right now.
my best friends live in another country but even an opportunity to listen to their voices or laugh at their jokes always brings fun in my life.
people, who read many books, are often wise and good speakers.
reading does not need much money or special preparations.
we ought to choose a book, buy it or find a free e-version and begin to read.
it might not matter, which ways we choose to be happier.
i work form home today.
it takes about 90 min from my home to my office. so telecommuting is really useful system.
i bought lunch in my favorite baker and had it at a beach near my house.
the wind was strong but i could enjoyed nice scenery and delicious and fresh bread.
i think that learning english becomes your weapon
in fact, we realized the synthesis and the simulation of processes, and now we are doing experiences with the aim of optimizing pretreatment and hydrolysis steps.
due to the limited technological averages that we have, we are limited to the sulfuric acid process, and analyses are limited to total sugars and some inhibitors.
the results obtained will be exploited for the rest of the process, in fermentation and distillation in which we have completed good results using simulation, mainly with molasses process.
i think it will be very interesting to conduct experimental work on pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation, as you described above.
however, i can support myself just for 3 to 4 months of stay in stellenbosch, and my school can only give me the travel expenses from morocco to stellenbosch.
otherwise, i'm attached by a contract with the school to teach a few hours until june, and with the pay i get, i finance my studies and with it i can fund my stay in stellenbosch.
i propose to perform some experiences here with the techniques we have, and coming to stellenbosch just to conduct a reduced number of tests to confirm the results obtained and to achieve the analyzes necessary for the rest of the work.
i will try to double working hours, in stellenbosch, if it is possible?
we can start also fermentation experiences, and your group will continue for the rest of fermentation tests, on my behalf.
someone tried to con you last night while you were getting into a club.
the rest of us is going to wait for you by the pool because someone farted in the house and it stinks as hell.
once you hooked one of your friends up with your neighbor.
does it still work if i put the word "up" next to the word "hooked" in the previous two sentences?
it was warm today.
in japan, there are some days that the strong wind blow s from february to the middle of march every year.
this morning, the weather forecast said, "the wind of last night was this first spring storm."
we say that on the day when the first spring storm blows, the temperature rises, but it will be cold return next day.
actually, today's minimum temperature was 9 degrees and the maximum was16 degrees.
i don't know how to say
i'm 24 years old this year,however,i'm still a student and i need parents give me money to live.
i know that i should study very hard,but i always don't know how to do and i can't stop playing my phone.
my grandmonther dead this year,my father and my grandfather are very upset.
i never see my father cry before,but this time he always can't stop crying.
i always tell myself that i must try to study very well,then i can find a good job and make more money.
only then can i take my family to play all over the world and buy things to them.
i like make plans,and most of them won't come true.
can you make change this time?
fightting!
it helps you to understand working life, relationships, disappointments, people etc.
one can only imagine these things before experience them and most likely his assumptions would not be %100 correct.
before we did it we talked about one hour long for the chat but i was so involved and having a good time that while talking i saw the clock in a sudden and i realised that we had been talking about two hours at that moment.
we were talking about different things on the spot.

in every language, must be found a problem that confuses the learner.
with a few words that have the same meaning, making the japanese language learners confused in choosing and using a word.
moreover, the number of synonyms in japanese has not been much explanation of when and under what circumstances such words are used.
whether included in a variety of formal or non-formal languages, written or spoken language, there is not much or almost no detailed explanation of it.
in the japanese-indonesian dictionaries were just simply written the meaning of the words without knowing the words synonyms are used in what context.
based on this, researcher are interested to discuss and explore more about the word synonymous in japanese that is isogu, aseru, and awateru, which in the indonesian language has the same meaning of 'terburu-buru', in research entitled "the meaning analysis of isogu, aseru, and awateru verbs as synonym ".
the three synonyms are often encountered when watching anime, drama, or when listening to japanese song, plus in dictionaries there has been no detailed explanation of these three verbs.
with these considerations, the researcher focused on finding similarities, differences, and possible substitutions of all three words in a sentence.
the method used in this research is descriptive analysis method.
data obtained from reliable sources of books, novels, dictionaries, and also the internet.
as a result, the isogu, aseru, and awateru verbs have the same meaning in indonesian as 'terburu-buru', but there are other meanings found.
this happens because of the consideration of the nuances of sentence when translating into indonesian.
for the situation it can be seen that the isogu verb is used when in a state of calm and can think with a cold head, while aseru and awateru used in the opposite situation.

some people believe that women should be allow entering different institutions like the navy, the air force, and the army exactly like men do.
through the course of history women have gained their role and have showed there was a misconception about them.
in the most male chauvinistic years society thought women were less important than men.
this idea was widely spread and the only way for women to shoot down this notion was to claim their rights and demonstrate their abilities.
moreover women and should be given the same opportunities in all fields.
however, there is another misconception: men and women are equal.

in conclusion, women and men should be equally treated, they should have the same chances in order to demonstrate whether they are able to perform certain task or not.

i have no idea about why it is called so.
since i hate the coldness, i feel happy about that spring comes.
so, i will spend a day of weekend with my daughter.
i'll take here out for a walk.
she really likes riding on the swing there.
when she rides it, she never want to leave there.
i woke up this morning with sound of wind outside.

i have been knowing her since 2003, she was my host family's grand mother when i was in new zealand so i call her granny too.
she has 2 daughters and 1 son, 6 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren, everybody loves her a lot.
i didn't grow up with my grandparents so i stay in touch as if she is my real grand mother.
she is a great baker, i had had a baking lessen from her 2 years ago, that was amazing experience.
i expect that she had a tough life, such as war and she lost her husband in early stage.
effect of yogurt
one of the my friends seems to make yogurt by herself everyday.
yes, i agree with her because firmamented foods are good for our health.
i heard we stated to eat yogurt after the second world war in japan.
i also heard most of japanese people are lactose intolerant.
in my opinion, many students travel the entire class to many places.
in these trips they can learn something new.
personally, i think that the most popular trip is visiting museums and art galleries.
in the sightseeing tour students can learn the history of their city or get acquainted with another culture.
these types of travel will broaden the horizons of students.
also, students can spend a weekend camping trip in the mountains.
this will teach them how to work in a team, and also be dexterous.
this type of trip will help students make changes in their everyday lives.
these types of trips, students can relax and develop their physical form.
to conclude, i believe that all of the types of students' trips have a positive impact on them.
they're digging the ground again trying to find where you hid the stolen diamond.
i understood that i need some communication more than just correcting of my texts.
i'll be glad to receive comments, messages and even suggestions about skype conversation from native-speaker.
it's funny to read my old posts, cause i really dont remember what i wrote.

but in generall it's good that i have some posts, cause i dont have any another diary.
one more thing i wanted to say.
my little niece has had temperature for two days.
she was a little bit nervous so i held her in my arms for a while, and she became quieter and calmer.
i hope that she get well soon so we can play together again.

bruce lee
i meet again with my friends
my friend has call me and told me he want to cook something at him home.
i arrived him home and we went to food shop.
it took a two hours but we could make an delicious curry.
i would like to know what is the subject in the first sentence of this song.
the temperature has risen recently, and it's changing from snow to rain.
snow melting has began to proceed rapidly.
the day continues on watching falling snow from the roof.
the movement for spring has begun.
today, i'd like to talk about my experience that i was really impressed.
i'm going to school in england, and i take a bus to get school.
it was the first day to take a bus in england.
i didn't know the price of fare and in addition, there were problems that i was familiar with neither the currency nor listening to english.
when i got ride on the bus, the driver told me the price too quickly for me to catch what he said.
so i asked him to say again and again, consequently i almost understood how much i should pay.
i got upset because some passengers were behind me and waiting for.
i looked up my wallet.
i understood it means that i can use credit card!
i thought it must take long time to find the coins out of my wallet and paying by card is more easier, so i pulled the card out.
but it didn't work, because the reader was only for contactless card and my credit card didn't have the function.
i got upset more and more.
i realized what i have the only way to pay is by cash.
i looked up my wallet again.
but he refused it because the paper money was so old and it couldn't use as money anymore.
i was quite upset and pulled put another paper money, but it was also the same, too old.
i felt loose completely, went blank.
they helped me, a poor lady without any kickbacks.
how kind they are!
what is the vacation of dream in my life?
oh, honestly, this is not easy question.
i would like to be in different places.
although wait, i know where i would be go now, in february.
certainly, i speak about lake baikal.
firstly, why i began to think about lake baykal after your question?
it reminded me one of the episodes from book, which you recommended me for reading.
the hero that book is man.
once he had reminisced about one day in childhood.
and writer was describing the nature with warm feelings and it was so pathetically and impress for me.
i liked to read it in english.
this view is unmatched beauty, i believe.
and it full wild animals.
for example, the nerpas, who lives there.
what is the nice picture when they are basking in the warm sun on rocks protruding above the water.
i would love to see them too much.
also it would be interesting for me to travel by train around lake baikal.
i heard, the shore of lake is filled abandoned tunnels, stone galleries and bridges.
i guess it is picturesque scenery.
it would be big mistake to miss it.
finally, i want to see the ice on to the surface of lake.
i saw a lot of photos different types of ice, and it would be cool to see it.
that is why i said about trip in february.
obviously, is the best time to seeing the heaps of ice splinters on to the surface.
lake baikal is truly interesting, is not it?
her work is making music, singing.
and high income women living in southern district and middle district.
liu tainiang has no talent, the music is not good, the song is not too good to hear, so there are not many people know her name.
she's just young and looks a bit more beautiful than ordinary people.
there were a lot of people in the day, and liu tainiang was dressed up very beautifully, so someone kept asking where she lived.
liu tainiang is very distressed, do not want to tell she lives in north district, but kept her head down.
later, many people asked, she said there is a tall tree in front of her home.
some days past, people are looking for the inconspicuous tree.
before this, no one care the tree.
i already don't want to remember bad experience about it and learning because i want to do.
eeveryday, i listeng to the english music on the television.
my favorite channel in this case it is hard rock channel, although i try to changen the music that i love, i cann't don't it.
i listen this music since i was eleven years old and i love its sound.
i feel passion when i'm listening the electric guitar and along with the lyrics of its music.
when i was a single, i had a date with an american guy.
he asked me " what are you craving for?
' i understand that now, however i didn't get what he ask about at that time.
i answered like " you?" i meant " what are you craving for?
" i should have asked him with full sentence, but i sometimes use my stupid trick like when i didn't understand something i asked or repeated the same question and worked out what was it or what did it mean.
however it was my big mistake.
he asked me "what are you craving for?" i said " you?" can you imagine this situation.
he was like " what!!!???" we went to ice cram shop after that and i found his way to have ice cram was not sexy.
it was melting ice cream were dropping on his hand and he wiped it on his jeans constantly.

it is how one reacts under difficulties that shows who he really is.
does it need a subject between 'that' and 'shows'?
and it takes some good--it takes some long time to get here from the beach.
this is a practice chinese-english translation.
fracking, the energy miracle in the us for drilling for shale oil, however is facing difficulties or even banned at other places across the globe.
a report form the guardian has explained the controversies of fracking.
it is implemented through injecting a great amount of water mixed with a bit of sand and chemical materials into a well at high pressure, to crash rocks and release the gas and oil to the surface of the well.
to see the problem in a larger scale, fracking also influence the climate.
i was impressed by large format nature photography taken by takashi amano before his death and nature aquariums by amazing aquatic plants layout.
i want to raise my english skill and want to deal with foreigners who come to japan in english.
when i tried to unlock the front door, i realized that i did not have a key of my house.
they are both working for a local financial institute and they are supposed to retire a couple of years later.
they are very frugal so i guess they would enjoy their life on receiving the pension from the goverment.
they nag me to get married or want to see grand child sooner from time to time.
i am in trouble but my age is appropriate to have family in japan.
they both have hardly been oversea in their life.
as for my mom, her occasion was hawai at honeymoon.
to go to foreign country especially asia is supposed to be dangerous in their thought.
because of that, they were clearly against my decision of working abroad in south ease asia a couple of years ago.
one of the good things to me was that they finally started to use mobile phone from feature phone.
so our communication is pretty easier than before.
when it comes to my mom, she is using it very well.
i am going to indonesia tomorrow for 2 weeks.
this my second time go to there.
but my first time go to there is while my 1 or 2 year old.
hope i am safe and come back my home.
conversation with mam over the skype.
"i heard it will very windy tomorrow."
"yeah, it will blow hard during morning commuting time."
conversation with mam over the skype.
conversation with mam over the skype.
"yeah, it will blow hard during morning commuting time."
conversation with mam over the skype.
there was warm wind today.
it was like a macaron.
i like it.
what i would do or like to do if i became a designer
well, i'm not a fashion designer yet but being a fashion designer is my final destination.
i mean, i would have anime characters wear my designed clothes in the anime and sell the same designed clothes in real.
everyone says fashion industries in japan are decreasing and it's getting harder to sell luxurious clothes.
i don't want to design clothes kind of like appeared in paris collection because that's different from my concept.
i personally think those kinds of clothes are for certain people by geniuses.
when it comes to designs, i want to incorporate kimono style to casual clothes, dress as well as suits.
it was really inspiring.
they have the celebrities in america wear their clothes as models.
actual kimono is pretty difficult to put on and move around but they put more value on them feeling comfortable.
don't you think kimono designs are very reflective to japanese tradition or beauty.
there are some things i've been thinking.
it was really inspiring.
well, i'm not a fashion designer yet but being a fashion designer is my final destination.
i mean, i would have anime characters wear my designed clothes in the anime and sell the same designed clothes in real.
japan's anime has become popular internationally, so i believe they will be great advertising.
i wish to design clothes that make people who aren't really intersted in clothes excited.

actual kimono is pretty difficult to put on and move around but they put more value on them feeling comfortable.
don't you think kimono designs are very reflective to japanese tradition or beauty.
i assume that the origin of tonkatsu is schnitzel.
they could had been introduced to japan many decades ago and then we recreated in our style.
are three years short?
most of their jobs including interns are limited in three years.
it is short but might be a good way as a trial.
for example, most foreign english teachers in public schools are from jet program or temp agencies.
it is short but might be a good way as a trial.
however, if foreign people want to work longer, what should we provide them?
local government should hire them directly and offer stable post and salary so that they can teach students constantly with a long-term strategy.
are three years short?
i wonder how foreign people working in japan think about their three years.
most of their jobs including interns are limited in three years.
some foreign people will become homesick, while others will dislike japan.
they may endure only three years or go back to their home countries.
however, if foreign people want to work longer, what should we provide them?
local government should hire them directly and offer stable post and salary so that they can teach students constantly with a long-term strategy.
i mean foreign language teachers should become government employees as well as japanese teachers.
i lost my earring today.
i don't have many earrings so it was very sad for me.
i lost my earring today.
my brother asked me about a plan of spring break.
my job was piled in front of me.
we have two big events.
one is the graduation celemony and the other is the entrance school celemony.
these two events are the most important.
my brother only wants to do a lot to be devoted to my mom.
of course so do i too.
i will have the result, if i pass it or not, in about 2 weeks.
i guess i did it pretty well, but i am not sure whether i pass it or not.
i do not want to study for the exam more 1 year.
i had a entrance exam for a university few days ago.
i have been studying hard to pass the exam.
i will have the result, if i pass it or not, in about 2 weeks.
i guess i did it pretty well, but i am not sure whether i pass it or not.
i really hope i will get a good news!
i do not want to study for the exam more 1 year.
review on "la cara oculta"
i'd been waiting for something chilling and thrilling more or less but the first scene i saw was devoted to their daily life.
i mean, the life between two people, which are madly in love with each other.
i thought: "omg, c'mon, this is the first spanish movie i'm watching, where are my expectations that i've been willing to see?".
but a little later i was absolutely ready to eat my words back!
i mean, you don't understand where the romantic line turns into something really chilly and macabre.
i'd never seen that star-studded cast before but i liked the choice the director cast different actors in the role of.
nowadays, the film keeps going to be under glowing reviews that makes it much more popular.
neither of other movies is able to show the same thing and the same idea in their chain of events.
i'd been always keen on america movie industry, but i even couldn't suppose that the spanish could create one of the best atmosphere for detective movies.
although it was cloudy in nagoya, the daytime was warm.
that is the reason that the center of a low pressure area passed through japan today, and warm wet air from pacific ocean blew into the center of it.
the broadcast says that it will be rain tonight.
ume blossoms in japanese, japanese apricot blossoms, are in full bloom with red color.
some white ume blossoms have started to bloom.
ume is thought one of good fortune trees in japan, that are pine trees, bamboos and ume.
the story came to japan from china that they endure a severe winter and they invite the good fortune to us.
ume trees bring us beautiful pretty blossoms, and their fruits that are made into pickled umes, ume sake etc.
ume fruits are very useful to us.
we could offer more tv programs, like fun-filled cartoon, to introduce young people to sciences.
these programs already exist but most are available on pay channels and are therefore not available to everyone.
in addition, to make sciences classes more fun, teachers could organize trips to interactive museums, where it's forbidden to don't touch.
they will discover, in a fun interactive and educational way: exhibitions, workshops, experiences and animations.
finally, it's very important to confront students to the reality of the world of work.
they will discover the sciences, not on a chair to listen to their teacher, but by participating in real projects with professionals.
i have hey fever.
on the way to my home, i bought eye medecine.
the thunder broke out at 10 p.m. yesterday.
the air is damp.
she has been listening this song on a loop for a few hours.
according to the weather forecast, the big spring storm has been coming up to my district from the southern part of japan.
it was about half past seven, a lady who is a money collector for newspaper subscription, came to my house.
i felt sorry for her who had no choice to work in the stormy night.
good afternoon,teacher.
i'm great honoured to be here for this interview.
now allow me to give a introduction.
i graduated from js university last year,and major in international trade and economic.
i like anything concerning economic,i also hoped i'll as expected work in this field and make some achievement, but when i finished my school, i realized that what i had learned was not enough for this target.
i thought it would be great if i can continue my interest in that, so that was that i choose to further my study with a master degree.
considering career prospects, i changed my major, international trade and economic to financial.
and i'm good at math,which great contribute to the study of financial.
but i know my english is not good enough,i will continue studying.
i'm quick in mind and careful in everything.
i'm looking forward to my postgraduate studies and life in hunan university.
i'll prove that your decision of choosing me is wise,
from the middle of january, my husband had been really nice to me.
he took me to akihabara and he asked me if i wanted anything.
he took me to the toy floor of a big electricity store.
monster hunter world; going to be released the following day, he wanted it.
according to his explanation, the software is downloadable and he can do it at home, but the consumer machine is really definitely necessary.
the monster game can be played with just ps4.
anyway he got the ps4 and downloaded the game at the midnight of the day of release.
because he still does the dishes and laundry before playing game and i can have more time doing my hobby stuff.
this is a kind of a happy life, isn't it?
people should be only allowed to laugh when i say so.
music can bothe improve your mood and depress???
i wish that i can meet you in my world.
today i went to my knitting class and started knitting a new vest for me.
since i started the class, knitting the vest was one of my goals.
i am happy that i could reach it.
i saw lots of advanced knitting projects which were knitted by my classmates.
they all were so perfect, and i sett up my next goal.
i am glad that i can knit among such talented knitters.
they definitely motivate me up!
from today i begin to study english grammar.
however, my skill for the grammar to do a communication couldn't trained very much because studying english were just object to take an exam.

a man driving car to backside for 11 000 kms in india

my friend has sent me a birthday present.
it is a pretty flower shaped earrings.
tomorrow is my last day to be 28 years old.
it's my birthday day after tomorrow.
i used to think that becoming this age is too far for me when i was a teenager, but my 20s went by in a flash.
i want to spend my last year of 20s with a happy feeling.
with an overwhelming progress of technology, our life is in changing in majority of things, technology makes the whole world to become closer to each others than before,and it spreads different cultures across the world so i'm not with who says that modern technology is creating single world culture due to different reasons that i will mention them in the following essay.
firstly, technology enhances the communication among people from different places by smart phones, computers and the discovery of the internet.
so, someone from the middle east can communicate with another one in the united state, they can recognize different habits, languages, ways of wearing and a lot of things.
for example, i have a friendship with a girl from south america which is a very cool girl, and while talking with her, i took and learned many things that i didn't have before, like her way of wearing sport and official clothes.
in addition to that, i become good of speaking english, because i was bad and afraid to practice the language.
also, i learned new american food and she wanted to try our food counrty so, i gave her different jordanian food recipes, and till now, she cooks and eat jordanian food and tell the others to try it because of their delicious taste.
secondly, with airplanes, you can travel to any place you want, discover new cultures and ways of living, you can give and receive in the same time; for example, my sister traveled to the us and studied in one of their universities.
in the same time, she worked as a teaching assistant, also she became a member of islamic center in their state, and she participated in many events that specialized for international residents to tell the others about her country's traditions, heritage, the famous places available in it, etc.
so, this is a strong point to ensure that our modern life is a road of spread new experiences and variety of cultures all over the world.
to draw the conclusion, technology enables anyone to discover many communities and exchange different things like languages, traditions, education and others that implement multiculturalism across the world.
i feel i can do it without hesitation if i understand clearly the reason.
i know i should think of it before i started with something in fact, and i may look stupid.
however, i think that it is the best shortcut for me to clarify the purpose when i'm stuck doing something because i can't do eagerly anything without reason.
i know i should think of it before i started with something in fact, and i may look stupid.
i feel i can do it without hesitation if i understand clearly the reason.

in some countries for leaving, you need to pay the fee of exit from the country.
this rule has applied for iran too.
it's interesting that recently the government of iran approved this cost has to become higher for those people who leave iran for second and third times.
it seems, a person who is traveling to other countries has made a big crime, so needs to penalize!
we are going to retrogression like north korea.

they beg for a few coins to buy ice creams and swear at those who refuse to give them money.
sometimes, they spit on cars, insult the residents or make pranks in the motel.
bobby, the janitor, knows very well that scooty and monee are doing a lot of silly things, but he also understands that they are just poor brats, all by themselves for most of the time.
he sometimes takes them in his office, just for a short moment because the two kids are impossible and quickly get on his nerves.
he always ends by throwing them outside when they become too cheeky and impolite.
bobby often argues with halley too, reproaching her for not paying the rent on time, for spending all day in front of the tv and smoking grass rather than taking care of her daughter.
the six-year-old girl hangs around with scooty, her best friend, who also lives in the motel with his single mother, ashley, who works in a local pub.
every day, from the back door of the diner, ashley furtively slips some waffles to the two kids, and it is almost the only meal they have everyday.

the range of theatrical fluctuates from traditional to experimental such as meta-theatre in which the line between a script and an improvisation blurs.
in the black comedy terrible and fearful elements are replaced by comical, and in the romantic comedy - an obvious clever scheming, happy coincidence, wondrous discovery which in the final lead to the fulfillment of all the desires of loving heroes.
i stuied english today
so i saied "hello
she accepted my greetings.
and i back home
i was glad to see my friend after a long time
we took five hours to drive there with our caravan on tow.
after driving 400 kilometers, guess which surprise awaited us!
in the meanwhile, the bursar put at our disposal the furnished apartment reserved for the chief supervisor.
what a nuisance!
however we had to wait for two weeks, before she complies.
i was told that at the town post office she used to allow herself to pass in front of everyone in the queue to be served first at the counter.
moreover mrs gorde had caused a scandal at the end of the previous school year.
strangely they had killed a hen supposed to represent the dreadful nagging woman and had carried out her burial in a corner of the playground.
the aimed person surprised them, demanded explanations and furiously kicked out twenty students without other formalities, without possibility of appeal.
the headmistress was laid off and transferred to another high school, in ussel, a nearby town, without having any say in the matter.
just arrived, on the orders of the chief education officer, i had to reasume the expelled students and receive their parents, in turn, to assure them that no proceedings would be taken against their children.
you can imagine i had many other cases to settle in my 25 year career!
it would be take long to tell you all of them at once.
we purchased a white porcelain service that we still use.
we bought a blue porcelain hen too.
when i look at it, old memories keep coming to my mind.
people sometimes ridicule themselves or are being modest.

to organize means that listing all i have to do and prioritize them according to my values.
i would want to concentrate on specific things rather than to do everything i want to do because i believe that i can have more fulfilling days.
its name was essentialism.
i completely agreed with the ways to think written in that book.
finally, all i have to do will be chooseing the best one.
but there is numeral before the noun.
my broken leg is well, i can play football again.

my favourite youtuber visited tower of london
she lives in london now, and introduces not only her unique life but also talkative londoners almost every day.
today, she uploaded a new video describing her funny visit to tower of london.
at the last scene, an officer wearing the uniform suddenly talked to kanon in japanese.
she said she had been in japan as an assistant english teacher for two years.

the walking dead season 8
the last half of the walking dead season 8 begins.
i think that the coming up with a production of a zombie drama as television series is cool and deceptively easy as columbus's egg.
the protagonists can endlessly travel around the north america, continuously changing members recruiting new ones to recover lost ones.
they have other continents like south america, africa, eurasia, if they want.
they might continue this series even until season 100, if they feel like it.
however, with glen gone and now even carl gone, this series has been recently losing its appeal to me.
i understand that even an important, attractive protagonist might die and that's the reality.
i'm not sure i'm going to subscribe the channel of the pay television this time.

my friend agreed and said if it was in china, the bridge scheme would pass "unanimously" and be done in 5 months.
then i thinked of the definition on the first page of our constitution - a people's democratic dictatorship.
yes i even looked up in the dictionary specially for this term.

could you call back in next week?
the work plan analyzes the economic situations of all developed and developing countries in the world, which means it focuses on all of the potential markets around the world, including india, russia, vietnam.

i went to an internet cafe in a while.
but they should know how dangerous this is.
i have reason to support my conclusion.
because you didn't use it so often and don't have a information literacy.
in addition, most important thing is to make teenagers learn how to control the service and why the service is dangerous, not avoiding the service.
based on the reason, i believe that teenagers shouldn't avoid using social networking service.

leaning basic economics in high schools
it is a good idea for high school students to learn some basic concepts of economics in their classes.
one of the great advantages of taking a class in basic economics is that they can learn to think logically.
economics is the most instructive subject to learn how to understand facts appropriately, how to think logically, how to analyze issues precisely, and how to express one's opinions persuasively.
it is a fiction book, about a successful factory manager who manages his factory, using some notions of economics.
at the earliest stage, he struggled to handle his factory, and he suffered from poor sales performance.
he accidentally met a professor who specialized in economics, and the professor pointed out accurately the manager's failure on his way of thinking about management.
the manager was surprised at the professor's accurate analysis and asked him to teach him to manage his difficulties.
this book is very instructive for me when i am facing some difficulties and problems.

i post something in english nearly every day in order to be exposed to english making good use of some apps including twitter.
additionally, people from the countries, where they don't use english as their native languages, correct my posts too.
english we taught at school is one thing, and english natives speak is quite another.
this means there are words we are used to depending on countries.
their corrections become confusing to me sometimes...
i believe it's very important to consider how they wrote in their native languages too not to change the meaning..
all we have to do on the apps for helping the others with our native languages is to correct the sentences without the changing what they are trying to say.
english spoken by natives sounds cool actually, and i long for it!
than you for your kind help!
i've been thinking about a trip in my spring vacation lately.

some people have a plastic surgery to make thier look yonger, but i think it's kind of risky and costly.
even if they had the surgery, the effect of it wouldn't last long since we are aging at every singe moment, and they have to do it again constantly, which costs a lot.
beside, there is no denying that they might accelarate their aging once they stop having the surgery.

bill of the young slave? in 21 century?
the bill obliged the students of community colleges to work without a salary.
until that point, there was no problem, but the issue emerged when the owner of the factory was not obligated to pay a salary to the students.
a career in a community college lasts three years, but the bill suggested that students must only complete almost 300 hours, without salary.
obviously, a lot of people, many students among them, protested against that bill.
a newspaper printed its cover page calling the bill as: "bill of the young slave."
but the response of the congresswoman was worse, she called that cover page like "terrorist." she had to apologise for that commentary.
days later, the congresswoman removed her bill from the camera, she just told the press that now the project must be debated with other organizations of students and the society.
in our country we have two institutions where the students can study professional careers, the first ones are the "universities", and the others are "institutes."
but i have read that those "institutes" are called in america as "community college"
in an "institute" the students can study technical jobs like design, tourism guider, mechanic among others.
when a consultant ask me to color-print on nice papers, i have to go up 5 floors and set papers on a printers and call another assistant to press print on the pc and pick up papers.

we had a enjoyed dinner, then we went to karaoke.
today,we has hungover but we had good time.
when i played final fantasy x years ago in a english dub, the conversation between two protagonists piqued my interest.
down the ages, the japanese have been shunning the direct emotional expressions.
therefore, japanese couples, married or unmarried, wouldn't say each other "i love you" even nowadays.
in the ancient literature, the writers expressed the idea of love by using implicit alternatives like "the moon tonight is beautiful, isn't it?" as in the present-day video games like the english-dubbed final fantasy x.
i am afraid that my reply may rude and too simple.
we really appreciate you inviting us to the chapter author of the manual.
please find the attached files.

i think it is important to reflect tasks.
regularly, tasks have some contents.
sometimes, some contents are not useful for the task.
we have to cut unuseful contents.
so we sometimes should reflect to check the tasks.

feeling towards computers
i used to dislike computers when i was a child because it seemed to me that a computer wasted a lot of time of adults.
i disliked seeing that parents spent a lot of time in front of the computer in our apartment.
however, now i grew up and i'm using them a lot.
more precisely speaking, i rely on them.
i study on lang-8 and cousera and enjoy american tv on netflix, so i cannot think of the life without computers.
why do they always hide what they feel at the moment?
do they fear of person's reaction?
nothing more, just thoughts intertwining in freaky knots that prevent them from acting directly.
the problem is hidden too deep and it takes some struggles to pull it out.
we constantly find indirect matters, but what is digged up in the very heart of the trouble - that's what we're only going to find out.
today was the day my husband had an interview for the job.

i didn't meet him recently.
i haven't seen him recently.
i haven't studied english recently.
i thought that she might have misunderstood what she had read, but i realized that if i used "recently" in the sentence of the past tense, it would sound strange.
"i didn't meet him yesterday" is, of course, fine because it includes a clear time "yesterday."
why does "i didn't meet him recently" sound strange to me?
yamada recently.

at the same time, that makes you choose your own future as well.
however, most of doctors have good salary, but for dentists this topic is better.
especially because dentists don't need to study many years as much as other specialists like, neurologists, cardiologists, orthopedic specialists, etc.
this fact gives a big chance to dentists to make more money from their field.
the maps provide a breakdown of the improvement a city underwent from 1700 to the present.
however, nowadays there are some contemporary infrastructures: a supermarket, traffic lights and a car park as well.
as for the paths, they are now all double-lined, with the exception of steggle road, where steggle farm was located, that is tree-lined.
at the intersection of high street and st peter's lane, there is now a roundabout and along the two streets, more shops and dwellings have been built anew.
the mall is located on a side of st peter's lane opposed to the lodgings.
on the other hand, the farms of the seventeenth century have been demolished to make room for a car park, new houses and to pave the aforementioned steggle road.
moreover, the stables, for example, have been substituted with modern flats and the field has disappeared.

not very useful and totally unpractical things like geometry and maths, but also interesting subjects like philosophy and chemistry.

hi, i write a essay. if you had plenty of free time, please read this.
endless bad dream.
recently i read a book named dagon.
i was remembering a novel, when i was reading this, mujina.
this is written by koizumi yakumo.
i let talk about mujina from now.
he didn't see her face because she hide it.
however she was seen her face by him.
he soon run away because she didn't have face.
he managed to find a person but his face looks like egg too.
then the light turn off.
next i want you to read dagon's end.
he went to the highest hill in here.
there was a big and deep hole.
he searched here and found an ancient stone monument.
it was drawn a man that was half human and half fish.
in addition the biggest fish man was as big as whales.
he imagined what kind of meaning this have.
then in front of him appeared the fish man that was drawn by the monument.
he was hardly run away.
despite the night with a full moon, he looked a vision about the monster.
i think it have two same points.
one thing, reality was changing over fiction.
in mujina, at first the woman spoke the man normally, hiding her face but she deployed her face.
next dagon, the man looked the monument before the monster appeared.
in these stories, daily life was changing over unusual.
next, these stories didn't have clear end.
we couldn't know what main characters happen.
it's seem to be endless bad dream.
we need to think what happened at last.
can you explain me the difference please?
when i must use the first and when i must use the second.
i'm pretty much interested in the cultural differences between in japan and in america.
the one thing i can say clearly is that most japanese people in japan are happy that non-japanese people wear kimono.
during all this week the weather will be cold, but next week will be warmer.
during all this week the weather will be cold, but next week will be warmer.
during all this week the weather will be cold, but next week will be warmer.
so we will see together the reasons for this decline.
indeed, several reasons explain this lack of interest for the sciences.
first of all, scientific studies are very hard and selective. this can strongly discourage students.
then, one wonders if this is not related to the disappearance of mathematics in our daily lives.
we all have today a calculator or a mobile phone capable of calculating on our behalf.
finally, it can be assumed that wages should not be commensurate with the effort provided during studies or work, or that it is low relative to the cost of studies.
to conclude, we can deduce that to give young people an interest in science, it is necessary to improve wages and especially to give them a positive image with a more attractive teaching with for example, workshops or internships with professionals.
it has been becoming warmer these days.
long winter will be over and spring is coming soon.
i have a lot to want to do if spring comes.
i have my driver's license but don't have my own motorcycle.
i have had the one while i was living in osaka, which is one of the biggest cities in japan, but i let go of it because keeping it took quite expensive cost every month.
i want to have my motorcycle again now since maintenance costs are not needed because i live in my own house, including some parking space, in a suburban.
also, roads are large and not crowded there.
i'm sure now is the best timing to buy the new one.
in advance, i am planning to go touring by a rental motorcycle with my friends.
so, i decided to go with my friends next time.
i want to go touring in united states someday.
i've been to grand canyon several years agree.
i can definitely feel great if i drive my motorcycle there.
one of the lawyers left the law firm where she worked for, because there was a disagreement over its policy among them.
however, she didn't take my advice, because she had a romantic feeling with him in a unilateral way.
i asked her what her complaint was, and she told me that he didn't give her a raise nor full-time job.
i changed my job three months ago although i have 7 years experience from career before.

every time when i meet is strange, new field, new people..
but, i have to do my best since i have two kids and wife who are seeing me as a strong man.

i would like to visit countries in that part of europe, and i'd like to do with some natives so they could tell me a lot of particular stories about their countries and they bring me to visit places out of tourist tours.
today i had to go to a supplier to solve a problem.

i've never been there so i don't know habits and history.
i would like to visit countries in that part of europe, and i'd like to do with some natives so they could tell me a lot of particular stories about their countries and they bring me to visit places out of tourist tours.
when will you be able to handover to new company?
i tried to describe my home town, osaka.
the sentence below is written as spoken language.
my hometown is osaka, the second largest city of japan next to tokyo.
it is located in west part of japan, called kansai region.
it is well known around the world, maybe especially east and southeast asian countries, for its amazingly variety of food and unique cultures such as manzai, a kind of entertainment talk shows.
the main language is, of course, japanese, however this is spoken with a very heavy dialect peculiar to the kansai region.
the advantages of living in osaka are the high employment prospects, the range of things to do, such as culture and social activities, and dozens of shopping malls and streets.
other industries are finance, retail, tourism, banking and so on just like same as other large cities all over the world.
anywhere in public transportation and shopping malls is very crowded and cluttered, and even though when you drive your car in osaka, you must feel roads are quite narrow and very busy with not only cars but also bicycles.
osaka also faces environmental problems such as air pollution, caused by heavy traffic, and also natural disaster, for example tsunami and earthquake, as 90% of its area is at flat and lowland area.
it also faces social problems such as overcrowding and homeless.
this force is called "force of king", and this force appears when conclude an agreement with "code user" who owns an ability that is called "code".
the representative one is "geass of absolute observance" that lelouch owns.
eyes of person who owns geass emit a purple light, and a symbol of phoenix emerge to center of those eyes.
however, generally, most of them are ability that operate a human's mind, and kind of the ability is decided based on content of a desire of person who concluded the agreement.
on the other hand, a strength of effect of geass is decided according to a aptitude of geass user.
therefore, if a person who lack of the aptitude concluded the agreement, an awkward geass that received a restriction appears, or geass does not appear.
the quote is a finest example of what i can going to write about.
we are often spellbound by enticing things in life and we indulge in them.
the child is never satisfy." that's how we are when we get older and responsible person.
we go in the search of fake happiness and nebulous the true one.
i have met so many rich people and what i notice that they always complain how sad they are.
some even want to become a monk as they don't care about the money.
but a poor person will laugh at the rich man as for him the money is the only happiness.
you can see the real happiness on their face.
i want to give example of it.
once i was going to temple and the taxi driver was talking and smiling as he won a lottery.
i asked him "why are you so happy?" and he smiled and said, "i'm always happy like this because i have everything and i don't desire for more." i was surprised and socked because he was indeed a poor taxi driver.
besides of seeing people in real life i have read some articles and they say money can't buy happiness.
for the true happiness you should learn to give and be kind.
i don't believe this because i am a person who always try to help others and what i get in return is sadness.
s i will answer that in next entry.
if you know the answer, please write here.

their are required to clean

will be finally banned everywhere?
on the one hand, that tabacco is unhealthy and annoying is a reality.
non addicted people have had to endure people smoking near them in schools, planes, restaurants or even hospitals.
for instance, in spain, students could smoke during the classes until 1988, however people could smoke in restaurants and public locals until 2010.
tabacco involves plenty of illness, for example, tumors or breathing difficulties.
furthermore, to smoke pollutes the air and hurts other people who breath the fume.
on the other hand, if smoking is banned in public places, people who smoke can think over they are deprived or freedom.
in addition, they can suppose they have less right than the rest of the citizens and it can bring demonstrations or strikes.
to sum up, i totally agree with banning smoking in public places, because the health is the most important thing we have.
if i were the president, i will ban smoking everywhere, except private houses.
most of countries have banned smoke in public places. especially, in bars and restaurants, public buildings or even streets.

i'll turn 22 years old this year.
here 22 years old is quite old but not that old for marriage.
when i looked at them, i was realizing that we already old and we were adults.
i still have a lot of dreams, i want to take my master, work as a diplomat, or maybe get a good job sooner.
in the other hand sometimes i think about marriage.
i'm curious about who will be my future husband?
sometimes i think what if i were marrying with someone who converted himself to the same religion with me?
i'm a muslim and i'm a female, it is not easy to muslim women who will marry a converted man.
i know, the women can help their converted husband, but it takes so much effort, patience, and sincerety, especially for the husband who can learn and wants to learn about his wife religion.
the marriage life will fulfill with good vibes and joyfull life.

the two texts present opposed points of views regarding tourist industry and its effects on the places where it is carried out.
the writer adds that not only are the towns themselves deteriorated but their populations too.
the second text tackles the controversy among those who firmly believe that tourism industry is seriously damaging and, on the other hand, those who object to this statement.
whereas the former ones make the point that the only aim of tour operators is to offer travellers the last opportunity to visit virgin places, the latter ones argue that some tourist companies are now trying to fix the damage previously done though this could be done for obscure purposes rather than for being concerned about preserving environments.
as mentioned above, both texts gives strongly opposed perspectives with regards to the effects of tourism.
according to the first text, tourism has turned idyllic places into huge tourist resorts whose only purpose is to satisfy their clients regardless which price has to be paid.
the writer supports his point quite well and although he draws a very pessimist picture, i could not agree with him most.
in conclusion, i very hope that in the short term, private companies and governments are able to cope with this worrying issue.
the two texts present opposed points of views regarding tourist industry and its effects on the places where it is carried out.
the first text highlights the fact that villages, which used to be peaceful and untouched, have been transformed into huge tourist hubs where buildings and nature have been completely spoiled.
people who used to work in traditional jobs now are working almost like slaves for tourist companies.
the second text tackles the controversy among those who firmly believe that tourism industry is seriously damaging and, on the other hand, those who object to this statement.
whereas the former ones make the point that the only aim of tour operators is to offer travellers the last opportunity to visit virgin places, the latter ones argue that some tourist companies are now trying to fix the damage previously done though this could be done for obscure purposes rather than for being concerned about preserving environments.

playing video games teaches us about life?
in my country, japan, especially parents generation do not believe that playing video games teaches us about life because they assume that playing game is just harmful and a waste of time for their kids.
however, i agree with the statement that playing game teaches us about life for following reasons.
most importantly, in most of video games, the main character is all about you as same as your life.
in rpg games, it is allowed to select your party, skills, ways, etc, and it is all up to you.
why don`t you go your own way even it is your own life?
that way playing video games make us realized how important to believe that everyone is necessarily the hero of their own life story.
although there may be disadvantages for playing video games, i strongly believe that playing video games teaches us about life.
usually, people tend to give up their goal or dream on the way while facing big walls or difficulties in their life.
nevertheless, they continue to try to beat bosses by training themselves in video games until the end even if the game over happens many times.
through playing video games, you are learning a practice of overcoming your difficulties instead of just forgiving it.
that is why you should never stop challenging in your life like your video games despite you feel depressed about your life.
because of these reasons, i insist that playing video games teaches us the important things in our life.
not only does this help to make you believe yourself in your own life, but also because you can learn how important to keep challenging.
in my country, japan, especially parents generation do not believe that playing video games teaches us about life because they assume that playing game is just harmful and a waste of time for their kids.
most importantly, in most of video games, the main character is all about you as same as your life.
it means that you can choose your life as you wish, and you always can be true to yourself because you are the only person who spends your life.
in rpg games, it is allowed to select your party, skills, ways, etc, and it is all up to you.
why don`t you go your own way even it is your own life?
that way playing video games make us realized how important to believe that everyone is necessarily the hero of their own life story.
in addition, playing video games teaches us that it is vital that once finished setting your goal or dream, you should keep following it until the day you die.
nevertheless, they continue to try to beat bosses by training themselves in video games until the end even if the game over happens many times.
that is why you should never stop challenging in your life like your video games despite you feel depressed about your life.
in conclusion, i suppose that playing video games teaches us a lot about our life.
it takes two hours to go there as riding time, and plus waiting time.
that means that a socio-pedagogical professional comes to your home and assists you and your family in the education of the children and in different other tasks.
we would like to explain some basics of the social services for families to you:
the company xx assists you by the order of the youth welfare office.
the employee therefore assists you primarily for reaching these goals.
these days, i hardly do the handwriting except my address or name when i need to put in some forms, because i use always computers or digital gadgets to write something.
more than that, i can't believe that i wrote all the papers and essays in longhand those days.
if you want to add or erase even one character, you have to rewrite all from that point.
if all computers and digital gadgets vanish, i will be at a loss totally.
i wonder how could i have memorized over 1000 kanj characters during high school.
more than that, i can't believe that i wrote all the papers and essays in longhand those days.
if you want to add or erase even one character, you have to rewrite all from that point.

me:"heart, listen, he is only a friend for me.
i regret to inform you that i will not be able to attend your morning classes from tomorrow on, because of an unexpected twist in my life.
it seems that i just did fine because a few hours ago i was contacted and told i had got the part-time job.
now, apart from being quite speechless and nervous due to the extremely short time i have had to make a decision, i must admit i am quite happy with this new career opportunity.
unfortunately, as i said, i will not be able to attend my classes any longer, and this is the negative aspect of the whole matter, and the reason i am addressing to you.
i was planning to sit the ielts exam in a few months, so do you think i could turn my morning lessons into a more suitable evening course?
would you possibly suggest anything different?
first of all, i talked about ps4 pro or nintendo switch.
i want to recommend ps4 pro.
the first point.
the resolution for mobile mode, which is the sale of the nintendo switch, is 1280x720 pixels.
in contrast to ps4, ps4 and ps4 pro both have a resolution of 1920 x1080 pixels.
however ps4 pro is compatible ith 4k so you can play with the game while keeping high picture quality on the tv screen.
the second point.
since ps4 pro is released before switch, cassettes are abundant.
however, since switch sells various softwares from now on, expectation expands.
i am also looking forward to nintendo lab released in april.
the third point.
the number of people ho can multiplay is different.
as an example, i chose battlefield from ps4 pro and mario kart from switch and compared it.
while mario kart is playing eight players, the battlefield can play with up to 64 players.
higher number of people makes the game more complicated and doubles the fun.
with the above, i would like to recommend ps4 pro.

i did a part-time job at a drugstore in the morning.
i had a few customers than i expected.
it was really nice to take a rest while doing part-time job.
after i finished my job, i went to a cafe in seoul that is capital of my country to meet an old friend of mine.
i think it would be the last meeting with her because she is going to study in german as an exchange student.
i knew that she's into cosmetics.

some time ago i started to go in dance school that named smile.

now we have time to learned only 1 element at each lesson.
but 2 month later count of elements were more then 40 and we were started to record video for each element, which we know.
now everybody in our group may open video and remember how to do this element.
it's very comfortable at self-training.
on holidays after class we gather at the table with our trainers and celebrating together.

there are many different opinions that some people are always in a hurry to go places and other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace.
to begin with, there are a lot of social problems such as the recession, an aging society, and declining population.
with the development of technology, we are required to work extra time and holiday work.
we don't have a lot of pastime in modern society.
therefore, we need to manage our life and a private time.
also, we need to have a high-quality job as well as the speed of the job.
if i finish a job in a hurry, i can spend a free time.
by getting a job done in a hurry, i can enjoy a free time.
in limited time, we must live our lives.
also, i visited ireland in a hurry more than other because i wanted to make friends and see a lot of places in ireland.
when i started taking a class at a school, i already have made some friends.
thus, going places in a hurry and getting things done have a positive effect on us.

everybody, who are in this room, know history of frankfurt market very well.
today, about 100 from countries, about 8000 books business come tu us every year.
trust is, that these lot companies and about 80000 professional visitors don't come just book market.
in early fifties years they discovered that business opportunities are for their, for example translation.
so, the frankfurt market became book meeting place of all the world.
trust is, that these lot companies and about 80000 professional visitors don't come just book market.

anybody knows what the animal is called "xolo" in chinese?
president xi asked for a non-limit period of being president of china.
however, i think mao's era can not come back as chinese people have been well educated from culture revolution which was launched by mao.
xi is not so foolish to be against chinese people.
i think xi need to concentrate the right of the party to push the reform forward and now he is doing it.
his target should be to change the situation of the party to the state, weaken the right of the party and strengthen the right of the state and finally, china will become a much greater country.
then, i received larger size pants than that i ordered.
i was irritated because that kind of mistake wasn't the first time on this online shopping mall.
they had called me when my size had been sold out before.
however, they don't call me for informing any more and they just send incorrect size or different colored clothes from that i ordered.
sometimes, exchanging is a bother thing.
i have to apply for exchanging online, repack it and send back it by delivery service.
therefore, i sometimes don't exchange and give them to my sisters or my friends.
if so, the online shopping mall doesn't make any loss even if they deliberately send different size or different colored items.
i was irritated because of their continuous mistake that it may be wilful.
i applied for refund online and sent back the larger size pants this time, but they made me very angery.
they didn't refund until i called them twice and asked refund again online.
it wasn't a considerable sum of money, but i hated to let them to lookdown on customers.
finally, i got back the money today!

i agree with the idea that in the stories of movies and tv programs, good people should be rewarded, and bad people should be punished.
children can be easily affected by tv programs and movies, and they can learn a lot from stories of tv programs and movies, such as the importance of being good.
for example, we have a famous tale in japan, called "a rabbit and a turtle." this story has been broadcasted again and again on tv for many decades, so almost all of japanese people, including children, watch and know this story.
the rabbit was able to run much faster than the turtle was, so the rabbit went far from turtle soon after the race started.
after the rabbit could not see the turtle behind him, the rabbit felt ease, became inattentive, and started to nap because of his overconfidence.
i believe that the lesson of this story is that it is great to do something constantly and diligently even if we are not good at doing it, and people who do that should be rewarded.
the major reason is that we can learn from stories where good people are rewarded, and bad people are punished.
for example, we have a famous tale in japan, called "a rabbit and a turtle." this story has been broadcasted again and again on tv for many decades, so almost all of japanese people, including children, watch and know this story.
the turtle overtook the sleeping rabbit, but the rabbit did not realize that.

in japan, the public things including roads and the restrooms are hygienic.
the mind of the hospitality of japan is splendid.
actually, the service of japan is popular among foreigners.
this book said the reason.
i just read only first and second chapters.
the way of thinking, "rhythm of rice cultivation" was interesting and fresh for me.
i am 17 years old japanese girl.
i will graduate from high school in march 1st.
but i get wrong i have friends.
i probably be alone commencement ceremony.
why i have no friends?
my niece is four years old, and she has went to nursery school since last year.
my smartphone standby display is a piacture of her.
when she was one year old, she looked her father but now her mother.
she imitates komedians apearing on tv.
if you hear this theme, you enjoy going to these places.
second, ingredient of the water.
third, hot springs make us happy.
although hot water of public baths are artificial water, hot springs are natural water.
lastly, i feel happy when i go hot springs.
hot springs make us happy but public bath only make us warm.
while hot water of public bath is tap water, hot water of hot springs are natural water.
then, i told you about ingredient.
while public bath has no ingredient, hot springs have some ingredients.
for example, sulfur and acidic springs.
while public bath makes us only warm, hot springs make us relaxed.
i may transfar to phillipine braunch abroad.
i have two anxiouses.
one of my anxiety is leaving my recent job and people in my work.
i like my job of now and people are so kind, and i always take care of me.
i was disappointed with myself.
i have negative thought everytime.
i am tend to think about tasks to do next when someone suggest one idea.
but someone have positive thinking is tend to do first.
i should change my mind positive.
if so, i will have more chance for success.
as you know, snowboarding has several ways to enjoy.
first of all, you can ride down a big mountain, which is not maintained.
you can feel the fresh snow and enjoy wonderful natural view.
or you also can jump and turn around at the specjal place called
"halfpipe".
by the way, i never did such a dangerous move, but i enjoyed watching snowboarding games of the olympics.
i do believe this application would give the chance, to a potential candidate, to explore further possible results, to play in a fully immersed experience, adopt new point of views and methods, exchange from the environments and their member and nonetheless create ideas.
i want to talk with foreign people in various countries, that is one of my purposes of learning english.
sightseeings are good,too.
i can see beautiful and huge sight which i can't see in japan.
travellings are great.
my wife and i have been to turkey on honeymoon.
we could see some huge sights and had a few friends there.
we enjoyed eating local cuisines and shopping.
however, we have not taken any trips recently, so we want to take one.
what is the most important when you take a trip?
as for me, that is sightseeing.
i'm sure that i can enjoy trips more if i could speak english fluently.
imagining that i have many friends all over the world is very exciting for me.
i hope i can meet lang-8 friends in reality someday.
with him it's safe to take a spin in my ride.
it looks like rain is comming.
i need a some hot tea.
how about you.
has the instant food improved the way people live?
contemporary, there are so many instant food all over the world.
the kinds of food are various, for example rice balls, sandwiches, hamburgers, noodles and so on.
we can buy everywhere like convenience stores or super markets opening 24 hours.
in my opinion, the instant food has definitely improved our lives.
let's imagine the situation that a working mother has just got back to home at night and has to prepare the dinner for their children who are already starving.
in the ancient time, she has to start with raw materials.
however, thanks to the frozen vegetables and ready meals, she could get the dinner ready for a short time, which leads to extend her relaxing time after the meal.
using the instant foods, we can enjoy much more free time than ever without them.
also i consider it very important that less injuries like cuts with the knives or burned with the fires are happened if we use the instant foods.
today, i had a change jobs interview after work.
i want to quickly end this activity.
working for other people can be a good thing what allows you to become a good professional.
when you begin from the scratch the fact of going into a company where you can find lots of experienced people who you can learn a lot make the path faster to become a professional.
but in some point, you discover that most of the time you are the person who are teaching to the others.
but this also makes you think that if you are good enough to teach people maybe you can be good enough too to run your own business.
besides running your own business can allow you to increase your standard of living and scheduled your own time to do it compatible with your life off the working.
i feel so good when i'm here that i don't want to come back home.
i'm waiting in the airport roissy-charles-degaulle.
in the first sentences the reader gets to know some insights and impressions about the employee mae and her trip to the francisco bay.
after all, she is convinced that knowledge is a basic human right that everyone should have access to it.
we can watch well squirrels in "squirrel's path" because we can enter there.
afternoon i went to a supermarket.
i felt a little embarrassed, because i don't have girlfriend.
she had her teeth pulled out yesterday, it bled a lot, so she didn't feel like talking too much.
afternoon i went to a supermarket.
the clerk asked me that did i come to buy chocolate.
i just bought a starbuck can coffee.
from the given excerpt we learn that is mae a young employee at a tech company called circle.
one day, she is going on a secret trip to san francisco bay with a stolen kayak.
more than that, she perfectly accepts the hard criticism because she admits that she behaved very egoistically.
yesterday, i went over to my friend's house, who is a japanese but grew up in the us.
his first language is english, but he speaks japanese the almost natural way.
i asked him to say it again, because the name of the company he mentioned sounded unfamiliar to me.
something occurred to him, and he said to me in japanese that it was zurich pronouncing "chu-ri-hi".
i don't know why, but we call the company or the city that way.
i can't believe because there's nothing in common how to call it between two languages.
there are many words like that such as athens and vienna.
i think it makes studying english more tough for us.
i back in japan for year!
i was really want to back to japan when i am in germany.
always i think there is good things in where not here.
so i do enjoy at now and sometime i miss something as not now.
today was my holiday and i want to utilize that time for my personal work but due to whole day power cut i am not able to do anything.
it was my fault that i am not charged up my laptop and mobile.
whose known that today will gonna be load shedding.
drugs epidemic
thousands of people dying for overdose every year.
it is thought that is not going to be a quick solution, so the autorities expect the problem will last for at least two decades.
it seems that the issue started with doctors prescribing painkillers in a not very addecuate way, at least not forseeing the addition of this type of drugs.
trying to stop the health problem the autorities and the health system begun to reduce the prescription of these medicaments, so people who are addited turn to sustitutes and go to the black martket for them.
it was more related with poor and marginalize people who went into drugs as a way to escape their situation.
many youngs lost their lifes in that period, whole families were affected and it was a really hard time.
in this days, there is no marginalize people who are using these drugs, is just people trying to cope with the effects of other drugs as cocaine and syntetic drugs.
i hope, that the authorities and the goverment forsee this problem and take the needed steps to avoid a major health problem.
i shovelled snow and i snovelled snow and i snovelled snow and i was very tired every day.
the snow mounnd is about 80 cm height.
1.'barbie doll' respects an aspect of a distorted beauty that is standardized and strange.
the third party looking a girl
sometimes, i've got this feeling as if i had been growing up in a carefree daydream.
the months end were always trying us.
around my tenth years, times became particularly difficult.
actually, it's also because my parents couldn't feed us anymore with the only pay of my father that my mother went in castres to open her shop.
at night, on his luggage rack, he brought back at home a cartboard box fulled with the suits that had to be tried or delivered.
thanks to my mother's new urban relations, he could gradually have some extra customers in castres.
the skeletons of the almost leafless trees swayed back and forth, their shadows synchronously gliding over the ground.
amidst this bustle of silently gliding shadows and stirred-up, rustling leaves i suddenly noticed a shape.
it was standing, motionless, at the bottom of the stairs that led to the backdoor of the inn, staring into the sky.
i had the toeic exam on january 28th, and yesterday i receive the results.
i ran out of time and couldn't finish the exam, but my score was pretty better than i expected.
i think i prepared enough for it.
anyway, i'm glad i could know my english level, even though toeic may not reflect my true skills.
honestly, i'm satisfied with my results because there are room for improvement.
my goal is to speak english fluently as native speakers do but i'm not there yet.
at least, this is the result of my work last two years.
i started studying two years ago, but i forgot when i actually started it.
she was my english teacher but now we're friends.
now, i'm relieved.
i stayed up late to study for it.
well, i can say it's more worthwhile than studying.
anyway, i'm glad i could know my english level, even though toeic may not reflect my true skills.
hmm, actually i would be liying if i said i'm satisfied with my results.
she was my english teacher but now we're friends.

my husband has been doing job hunting lately.
he has been studying even harder than usual in order to be hired in new field.
he has worked in branch of american firm in japan.
he is thinking to move to foreign firm in japan this time, too
he is going to be interviewed in english, so he has been studying most of his time currently.
however, he has been struggled with making an answering script for the interview that he can not make it the way native english speaker makes.
stimulated by him, i have been studying english by outputting and memorizing new words.
i think so-to-speak teachers' roles are mainly two things, sharing their knowledge with students and supporting students who try hard to advance toward their goals both educationally and mentally.
they always pleasantly tell children not only knowledge, wisdom and tips, but also their experiences that they consider are good for children to know.
even those are shameful and embarrassing for parents themselves.
who else except for parents can tell us the ashamed stories in their ever lives?
that kind of stories is usually the best advise for the young.
additionally, needless to say, parents always support their children, especially mentally.
and also, they grasp deeply about the strong points and weak points of their children.
parents are the only existences which can guide us toward the short-cut to the goal based on our individual characteristics.
when i study english by myself, i usually write first and then i listen some english tv program, often about cars or houses.
every episode has different protagonists, some of them speak very clear so i can understand pretty everything, but other ones speak quickly and with slang so i don't understand anything.
in those cases i stop the video and i repeat many times the sentence i haven't understood but there isn't anything to do, i don't understand.
i don't get discouraged and i continue to train my listening.
language learning - is my passion.
through the language i can learn more about people and their culture.
so, that`s what i`m basically doing.
my hobbies apart from languages: fiction and self-development books, bodybuilding, psychology, poetry, chess, philosophy.
as regards your studies.
except to japan.
people lies and another who say truth hurt, where is the justice then?
manners are a way to showing respect and kindness for another people.
we will be perceiving in better way if we will behave well.
everyone should be respectable and also respect others because everyone want to feel good in that world with people, not alone.
slowly went back to my life prior meeting my dwarf friend and hearing all that rubbish about those hidden libraries.
i've been tracking tim's behavior lately and it's been a letdown for me.
he needs to dispel all his preposterous fantasies about the people in the office fostering innuendo against him.
psychologically speaking, he's heading off for a very dangerous trip.
his nascent paranoia probably stems from his love for drama.
he's always on the quest for excuses to play the victim.
if he blocks you and gets angry, stand your ground, pick up the story.
if you feed your imagination with distressing falsehood, as the result of that, you will become nuts.
he'll eventually become incapable of zeroing in on any realistic or constructive criteria, when the time to benchmark ourselves against our competitors comes.
his strategies, so important for us, will stop being actionable.
they will lose the breadth and depth that we need in them.
no siree bob.
we can't allow this problem to degenerate.
solve this, even if you have to walk him through a primer in mental strategies to block his paranoia.
tell him he needs to shed his old mental models.
i think many people would not be even able to easily remind how they looked.
when it comes to spiritual objects, however, the story seems to be qualitatively different.
it is much harder to make one of such objects go away.
far more importantly, one enters the theater with the feelings very similar to those that their distant ancestors had before the start of the performance, say, 200 years ago.
even if one prefers to read from an e-reader rather than feel physical paper pages and flick through them, this does not mean at all that they have never bought paper books before, or will never buy them on occasion.
for example, dataism, the novel trend which is the product of computer sciences and modern biology, argues that the dataflow is, or is about to become, the most valuable thing in the twenty-first century.
material world versus spiritual sphere
carriages were completely replaced with the mass production of cars.
no one is using horse-drawn carriages as a mode of transport nowadays.
when it comes to spiritual objects, however, the story seems to be qualitatively different.
it is much harder to make one of such objects go away.
for instance, the rise of the cinema could not significantly affect the theater, just as the internet did not manage to 'destroy' newspapers or radio.
but after a while the balance was restored; those who sincerely loved watching theatre performances returned to their favourite pastime.
far more importantly, one enters the theater with the feelings very similar to those that their distant ancestors had before the start of the performance, say, 200 years ago.
i am just thinking that maybe this law is called a double sinusoid, because a process concerning the spititual sphere, no matter what it is, first experiences a downward trend which is usually followed by an increase, and it may continue this way.
such considerations may lead, or at least, contribute to the idea about the infinite and somewhat special nature of the spiritual sphere in contrast to the totality of objects constituting the material world.
to put it in another way, novel things appearing in the spiritual kingdom neither prevent the old ones from prospering nor make them obsolete or superfluous.
even if one prefers to read from an e-reader rather than feel physical paper pages and flick through them, this does not mean at all that they have never bought paper books before, or will never buy them on occasion.
as for my opinion, i think that all this sounds, at least to some extent, convincing for us, contemporary humans.
for example, dataism, the novel trend which is the product of computer sciences and modern biology, argues that the dataflow is, or is about to become, the most valuable thing in the twenty-first century.

this book very impressed me when i read it a few years ago.
it is the most influential book for me, because this story is a metaphor of limited and spiritual poverty which are able to kill everything living and creative.
i think that is the best book of marquez.
this book about incredible patience and dignity.
these novels about journalist who works in one soviet newspaper and protests against the unconscious absurdity of the soviet life.
it is an interesting story about nature of humanity which was shown through the incident with the bus which lost its way and got stuck in the mud.
it is about little boys who live the opposite evolution, turning from civilized children into savages who are able to kill.
the story of freedom, which implies responsibility, and the fact that youth and innocence aren't synonymous.

i think you told me before that it was getting better so why you can't be back to gym?
the problem is how can i travel there with him without anybody knows.
anyway, i told him i'm not sure if i can meet him so i think he got the message that i'm not keen to do so.
btw, safy didn't like the idea to travel with him to aswan.
this was an extra reason why i told him that.
is it ok in western culture people who like each other or are friends to send nudes or show intimate parts of body during video calls?
while another holland one said 'it happens but not normal and people who do it either pervert or stupid'.

hello, i'm currently preparing for english exam.
i really need help correcting my writing, it's little bit long tho!this is my essay below with question.
issues regarding new traffic developments are always hot potato since lots of profits are related with it.
some people insists governments should invest more on railway construction rather than roads for public benefits, while others disagree with the statement.
in my opinion, it is more beneficial to develop railways and detail reasons will be discussed in this essay.
firstly, good public transport infrastructure contributes to improve environment.
in detail, people would prefer to use public transport than own vehicles if they can easily access to remote region by public transport.
because they can save not only money but also time instead of driving.
as a result, decrease of car using rate may reduce air pollution.
as a similar case, copenhagen, the most famous city for a lot of bicycle commuters by developing bike lanes, got clean air condition.
secondly, improvement of public transportation is essential for balanced regional development.
to be specific, having better connection to other cities brings regional economic boom.
it shortened the way to gangwondo, only taking 2 hours from seoul station.
although the olympics was over, this railway is expected to carry a lot of travelers and stimulate economic growth in this district by experts.
thus it is reasonable that government should allocate more budget on railway for the future.
it was impossible for you to tell if they were lying at you or not.
i was working in the school 1 year.
i decided to quit this job because i make small money there and i very difficult to work with childs 13-15 year old.

although trpg is not so exquisite as electronic games, it has an ultimate freedom for players to take advantage of their imaginations.
also i make a lot of friends playing trpg, who have an imaginative yet positive attitude towards life.

recently the working environment start to change in japan, but still, many executives think that employees are required a royalty of their company.

even if you switch the job in the same industry, there are many different things.
and no need to say, different people are working in another office.
that will change your mind, and helps to understand the thought of another people.
i'm sure you can get another aspect of work.
i am going to sever some friends.
recently i am thinking about it is not to need any more the relationship that is shallow and light.
as the quality of relationship is more important than the quantity.

i had this fantastic dream last night, that kind of dreams which you just don't want to forget.
"what did you dream about", you may ask.
it is about murderous lipstick used by an android and brown "rose", descendents of the doctor and genetic mutations.
last week end i went to shiga kogen in nagano prefecture to ski.
this place is one of the most popular ski resort in japan.
the reasons for the popularity are following.
because shiga kogen is located above the mountain which is over 3280.84 feet, it's very cold and the snow won't melt.
it's too vast to play all courses in one day.
skier can move easily between each ski resorts by transferring the lift.
in this time, i was surprised to know that many foreign skier visits shiga kogen.
twenty years ago, there wasn't foreign skier.
it's great for foreign skier to visit shiga kogen.
in japan, the number of skiers are decreasing every year and the number of ski resort that is closed are increasing.
visiting japanese ski resort helps for ski resort to survive.
thank you foreign skier!!!!

curling is very interesting sport
i am so happy that the japanese women curling team for the the pyeongchang olympics won a bronze medal.
they fought against the england team for third place.
i was worried that they had might lost because the england team beat the japan in the tournament.
that winning is the best record since the japanese curling team participated in olympics.
attraction of this sport is team play.
a prayer who is going to shot last is considered very important but until the prayer shots, other prayers have to shot a stone accurately and take good position.
through this olympic, i found that curling was exciting sport and hope many people will know it.
thank the japanese curling team!!!!
i thought about the philosophy that azeem held, and it somehow was giving me confidence to fight for my rights.
aman wadi was very happy to know that aunty fariha was pregnant again, and that her altra sound tests showed that she had a baby boy again.
mother knew that if she replied, awan wadi would get angrier and she will make a mountain out of a molehill.
and some he leaves on us to deal with.
i had often win the races from my brothers, so from the bets, i had collected almost 200 rupees.
she had again started arguments with my mother.
they believed he listens the wishes and fulfils them.
father believed that pir saeen to whom aunty fariha went was not the true saint.
he believed that saen shah was the true saint, so he sent mother to his shrine.
pinkey went with mother, and all other children went with their parents.
he took a knife and started to peel of the potatoes.
however, other parts of their behavior might not be.
i cannot understand this why people misguide others.
only god would be "unlimited".
because i got free ticket.
ganbanyoku means rock bathing.
the rock bath make me refresh.
because i waste only with bedrock bathing, i attended a studio lesson.
it is a lesson program that mix various types of dance.
the teacher called me like coming near.
because, this lesson had peas part.
i was excited that i suddenly danced in front of everyone.
there happened something with our constitution yesterday.
even if you report your opinion successful on network, it will be deleted by the website as soon as possible.

i watched a video that shows the sales of expensive home appliance is increasing.
these appliances enhance functions that can reduce time for doing household chores for working women.
the video introduced as follows: a robot cleaner,dishwasher, high functional microwave that cost double more than general one, and a washing machine where we can comand tasks via a smart phone.

therefore, it makes sense that sofisticated appliances would be a real help for them.
in my case, although i don't work every day, my husband is agaist sharing chores.

my son and i like this temple, because the scene of numerous statues is surprising and a masterpiece.
i often dropped by a store of tableware, because the area is famous for kiyomizuyaki, gorgeous earthenware.
my daughter and husband often stopped by a shop for foods, and my son was pretty interested in a store for japanese swords, though they were just fake ones.

i have some questions about "what if an imaginary situation is something mixing up different times".
for example, when i want to talk about something happening in the past of an imaginary situation.
because you "went" to a coffee shop and "saw" her sitting beside the window the previous day.
then, you guys chat and have a good time.
will you ask for her number?
would you ask for her number?"
ps: by the way, since talking about the plot of a book, movie, or video can mix tenses like this to convey a better picture of what the plot is about, i think talking about something imaginary probably follows the same rules.
for example, when i want to talk about something happening in the past of an imaginary situation.
down below are two examples.
example 1,
-------------what i say to my friend:-------
then, you guys chat and have a good time.
will you ask for her number?
-------------what i say to my friend:-------
you were walking on the streets.
because you "had been" to a coffee shop and "had seen" her sitting beside the window the previous day.
it seemed like she was your right one.
would you ask for her number?"
can i mix tenses like the above examples when i talk or write about something happening in the past of an imaginary situation?
thanks you to help me study english.
when i returned, i tried to contact with you.
if i did something wrong please let me know i will correct.

he got it from a member of the town community when he went on a bus trip together with members last weekend.
my husband hadn't known somebody who caught the flu on the bus, so i shouldn't blame my husband.
after he came back home, he said he felt chill in his back and asked my son and me whether it was warm enough in the living room.
he went to see the doctor on thursday, which means that i spent three days exposing the flu virus without any protection.
on friday evening, i had a sore throat and a headache, so i went to see the doctor on saturday morning.
at the reception desk, a nurse asked me about my symptoms; i said, "i have a sore throat, a headache and a cough, but i don't have a fever."

i'm not a digital native, and in those days i used to read audio mags with abundant ads of technics record players and sanui tape decks and sony amplifiers and all other analog equipments, dreaming of the day i grow up and afford to have them all by myself.
however, now that the days of all those good old analog audios passed away, i can't get enough satisfaction any more.
although i can get any type of digital audios, mobile or not, in reasonable prices these days, and they provide reasonably good sounds, i coudn't get satisfied enough and i don't know why.

nowadays there are many studies and research fields with focuses in history.
i am convinced that history is a discipline that has a great number of important approaches.
they have the wrong idea that the past has already happened and studying past events is a useless activity.
history teaches us about the way the world works, and it helps us to understand people and societies.
we can learn about some lessons from the past that could help us to not make the same mistakes, because events of the past shape actions to come.
in addition, everyday there are new discoveries of the past that help us to complete the puzzle of who we are.

the dinosaur.
"when he woke up, the dinosaur was still there."
i had read it some years ago, but didn't find it really interesting.
i am not fond of reading much literature, but i think this is the reason why i like it.
during my lifetime i have ended up reading a lot of junk literature, especially when i read books that have been written recently.
to me, the current status of this art is very poor and it's not even a shadow of what used to be.
i am digging a bit into this because i want to remark the difference between these two types of literature.
what i like about "the dinosaur" is its simplicity.
however, the critics flattered his stories for their originality.
as for the meaning of "the dinosaur", i think it could have several interpretations.
leaving metaphores aside, it could be that the dinosaur is part of a ficticious world where the man dwells, and when he wakes up he finds that he is still trapped there.
to me, there is not any meaning, or there is a less important meaning, and the quality of the story resides in its oddity.
did you know this story?
i had read it some years ago, but didn't find it really interesting.
to me, the current status of this art is very poor and it's not even a shadow of what used to be.
i am digging a bit into this because i want to remark the difference between these two types of literature.

then i used the key to open the door to my home,on second thought,ah, why did i have to take a risk to jump back!?
for this reason, they prefer don't share their books with anyone.
i respect to these people, but for me it's different.
i mean, i never shared my books with anyone, or i only gave them to those people who i trusted them and wrote their names and the name of every book in my notebook.
before every new year, i check my shelf book and give all books that i don't need them to everyone who wants to read them.
i felt that he is not so skilled, because he hurt me a few times.

day before yesterday four of us in my class went to the ganga ghats. we were assigned some homework on the ghats.

after coming back from the ganga ghats that dat, i had an excruciating headache.

my neck was meanwhile waiting for the fall of the guillotine hanging before my eyes.
on my right, two man were having a seemingly friendly conversation.
one of them was not content having to work just before lunch.
besides, one always needs a bit of rest after a work like that.
"i get home, and while i am eating, the only thing i can see is the last corpse's afterimage!", he said.
then, he looked at me with a somewhat mean gaze, as if it said that i was not worth to be in the imagination of anybody.
"i understand you", he said.
they had probably laid me in a bad position on that bed, and that led to a very painful backache that was continuously growing.
in the sky, the sun had reached its maximum of brightness, and it was unbearably hot.
"fine!
this can finally start", one of them said.

there was a heavy rain while i was going out.
i really want to go home and change my snickers to slippers then, but i didn't, seems it isn't appropriate.
it is very distracting and uncomfortable during the entire test.
i didn't finish the reading parts, i feel very sleepy after listening 100 questions, i think i should get more practice being concentrate in such long time.
it is very tired chasing high scores sometimes.
i set an alarm at 8 am.
there was a heavy rain while i was going out.
i didn't finish the reading parts, i feel very sleepy after listening 100 questions, i think i should get more practice being concentrate in such long time.
i can anticipate the score won't be very pretty this time.
i think i need changes.
when you get used to a certain way of life your life is predictable and you think to keep it under your control.
to make changes means to lose control.
what can be more scaring then that?
sometimes it seems to me that energy i could direct to positive changes in my life i waste on doubts, fears and useless thoughts.

but when i went the clothing shop lately, i tended to got a purple one.
then i realized i was in middle age.
with a phone, we can enjoy music everywhere, and we can know everything around the earth in time.
everything seems to be very convenient, but soon a phenomenon appears: more and more people are addicted to the mobile phone.
it is just the phone that causes the embarrass.
the phone shortens the distance between someone around the world but lengthens the distance between the man who is the closest person of the woman.
in summary, with the more rational use of the phone, instead of addicted to it, we will witness the better service the phone can provide for us.
as i have been stolen my id to buy an electric appliance, i am deeply concerned about this issue.
otherwise they do not know what to do and thieves can make money easily.
secondly, police should be ready to solve internet crime.
since it is quite different from conventional crime, they need to hire proper experts who can use skills to defeat the bad.
it is required to be done as soon as possible.
thirdly, it is necessary to legislate to prevent consumers because law has not been designated to deal with the internet.
the government can make providers to cooperate.
i am afraid that they might prioritize their profit.
in conclusion, i suggest three measures to tackle rapidly increasing internet crime as i mentioned above.
unfortunately, police is not willing to cope with cybercrime.
when i called, they did not accept my case.
they are overlooking criminals.
this morning, i sat down on the bathtub in which is filled with hotter water than usual to make my body heat up.

however, i never realised that was the first misstep i had taken.
a few weeks after discussing with him, i realised i had nowhere else to get books from.

he is cooking a home-made pizza.
after dinner i'll play with my one year old niece who i love, she's stolen my heart.
recently i have rediscovered the joy of coloring books.
later i drew and made the art homeworks of my brother and cousins, just because i liked it.
i even think i got into makeup not to be prettier but to play with different shades of colors.
it feels a little silly to write but i think this could be part of my weekly routine not to get crazy about what life can throw at you sometimes.
laura's apartment is great, super comfortable, cozy and, well located.

nowadays, anything you want to tell your country or community or even the whole world about it, you can share it in different ways and in easy manners.
firstly, we are living in an overwhelming progress of technologies, you can share any idea, picture, video about anything in any country by using free social medias and mostly your post will spread in simple ways.
for example, my friend has done a nice project about medicine that done by doing a lot of research in our country, so he use facebook, snapchat, and instagram to share his project and give many glimpses and hints that attract audience to be curious to know more about this project.
his project toke two months to spread in all areas of the country, and he has taken various benefits and rewarded by the king of our country.
they advertise about this investment in all types of announcement, like posts on facebook, posters in the streets and near the public buildings, announcements in radio and television, advertisements in different websites in the internet, and in the end, everyone i met was knowing or talking about this investment, or wanted to go and try their services.

well, i knew a lot of cool stuff from books, but my practical experience was limited by a few outings in the peri-urban castrated forests with heavy backpacks full of food, guitars, playing cards, and other useless doodahs.
strangely, we could survive without alcohol, cigarettes, and as for charming girls in reasonably tight sports pants, they accompanied us only for inspiration.
jack london, my greatest inspirer, wrote about people like us very clearly: there is certain kind of people who confuse their urban sentimentality and overactive imagination with the true sense of adventure.
those people, make overambitious plans, buy expensive equipment, and deliberately ignore every single advice from experienced travelers.
so, being a weekend voyager and reckless couch climber, i had all those sins except, maybe, only one: i did listen carefully to experienced tourists.
i had to go down the dirt road a quarter of a mile or so and then turn left.
it was mid-spring, and the forest looked dull and scarce in color.
it would take time before pines and other trees get brand-new green dress and forest glades become flooded with wildflowers of bright colors.
you can find a surprisingly big variety of flowering plants in the taiga forests, especially in late spring, but the only true king of siberian spring blossom is, undoubtedly, his majesty bagulnik.
its scrubby bushes, dotted with tiny countless flowers and rosemary-like leaves are distant relatives of heather and are quite common in the northern forests.
whole fields of it, as well as single bushes, can be found almost in every corner of siberia.
in the mid-early spring when the taiga forest, bleak and hungry, wakes up from the winter drowsiness, whole fields of it paint cliffs and forest valleys in hot pink color.
i dare say that this spectacle is no way less fascinating than sakura blossom.
basically, there are two types of the taiga forest: light and dark.
but if on your way fir branches slap your face, beware -- this path was trodden by beasts.
go back and find a proper way.
you might have heard about all kinds of dangers that wait for the man in siberian taiga forest.
in real life, however, it happens on extremely rare occasions.
the exception to this rule is the time when those dangerous beasts look for a partner or foster their kids.
but there are two highly dangerous things you have a good chance to encounter in the taiga forest.
in order to protect yourself from those creatures you need special clothes, mosquito net, and repellent.
one of the reasons i chose mid-spring for my adventure was to avoid dealing with those tiny devils and hit the road before they hatch out.
the second deadly enemy of a traveler in the siberian woods is low temperature.
i mean just low temperature, like 5-10 c above zero, especially in windy weather.
and if you want to be a really smart ass, take a pocket survival kit with you too.
the foreigner is hard to borrow a room in japan.

scientists announced last monday that they have mapped the complete genome of a vampire bat for the first time and found there exist certain dna characteristics in the blood that help it grow only by consuming the special-flavor food, blood, which provides unbalanced nutrients only and also put itself in risks of diseases.

the trip to that town would have been fun like an excursion, if it hadn't been a business trip.
the flower put on my left shoulder was given by my mother.
i would have wanted to ask him if he would really have liked that singer if it hadn't in the case.
the taste smelled like the first decade of this century.
even if it had worked, i couldn't have been able to use it for that.

at the wing of the stage, there was no heating, but when i played hikaru utada as he had asked, i already sweated.
i should have felt like "it's easy, i can do it".
it played only a few seconds, but i was sure that all the people in the gymnasium heard that.
i didn't know why, but when i must have played the canon by johann pachelbel, the clever machine was tuned to a local fm radio programme.
fortunately, after my first mistake, i did turn down the volume to the zero level after every mission, so it didn't actually whole the gymnasium sound yet.

you may not see it interesting, but i would like to talk about buoyancy in animals, since i have to do a work for university on this topic.
on the other hand, buoyancy is crucial for those animals, like planktonic copepods, that can't do it.
they are unable to swim, and this is because they have to face the same drag force, namely viscosity, that other bigger animals do.
the strategies to become less dense are various.
this vessicle can retain gases of the circulatory system, and these gases make the fish less dense.
in swimming animals, the main advantage of buoyancy is to help to move horizontally.
seals, which have a thick layer of fat under their skin, have been found to swim faster when they are neutrally buoyant.

renewable energy
each time more countries pay special attention to renewable energies.
specially, all those countries which have not got fossil sources.
among, the current renewable energy sources are such as: wind, sun, water, etc.
nevertheless, their main concern is that they are not very establish in their production.
thus, the dependency of the fossil energies is total by the moment.
for this reason, many governments, from countries no generators of fossil energy, are focused on the development of renewable energy storage system.
the establishment of this technology obviously will involve an initial investment, probably, an important investement but later it will be recovered and addittionally, the beneficts for our health and our decendents will be unpredictable.
the use of renweable energy would reduce significantly the pollution and with that, the warming effect that it is provoking very strong changes in the world climate.

one week ago, i was in a train to go to the airport.

my friend said it was so tiring, then they went to sleep so early after took a shower.
so i focused on two things: the importance of highlighting words and concentration.
i think highlighting the keywords is a very good way to focus on the details of the content you're about to listen to.
when you start listening to the recording you will already have a clear idea of the topic and of some precise pieces of information.
concentration is something you should also practice hard not to go nuts after a few minutes.
it's really useful, but there are some concerns for me.
if more useful input method emerged, i would do more task while my transit time.
i would start slow and i will do this maybe 30 minutes a day.

he would often tell me stories of the outside world, of other cities, of hidden libraries.

the paradox of familiarity and the level of difficulty to describe that person
i just realised that the more you know someone, the more difficult it becomes to describe it.

please help me amend grammar

the british airways has had big troubles with the low quality of the meal service for decades.
so the executives asked heston blumenthal, who is a famous cook in the uk, to enhance the meals drastically.
this documentary reminded me of so-called 'the british disease.' the ba executives just waited for the new dishes to come to their table, like it was somebody else's business.
also, ba's chief chef wouldn't accept heston's scientific advice: your sense of taste differs between on the ground and in the air.
however, the fact has been well-known among people in the airline industry for the last twenty years.

relaxing of broomstick
in vietnamese families, broomsticks are daily used for a cleaning up.
during tet holiday as known as a lunar new year, however, they are relaxed, especially on the first day of the year.
this custom is popular in all through vietnam and the origin of this custom came from an interesting fairy tale.
in the olden time, there was a woman who very excellent in cooking.
however, she often stole meat and wine for her boyfriend since she was appointed.
once time, the ruler of heaven was going to hold a huge party for his magnates.
the feast was prepared quite well by her.
by chance hearing the new, her boyfriend broke into the imperial palace and then ate some of the foods on the sly before the party started but she was unaware.
the ruler of heaven found out something wrong on the feast and thus, the manager of the kitchen was summoned.
she was telling the truth about her boyfriend and the times she stole meat and wine.
she was sincere subjected to a punishment.
ever since he punished her to turn a broomstick and made her work and scavenge to the home garbage every single day.
many years have passed, the broomstick worked very hard.
the ruler of heaven was moved and so that he allowed her to off three days every beginning of new year.
above story explained the reason why vietnamese do not use broomsticks to clean floors during tet holiday.
they would like to award the broom a pretty relaxing.
even today, when people may equip vacuum cleaners for cleaning instead of broomsticks, but they still do not clear out dirt and trash at home, especially on the first day of the year.
moreover, they believe that they don't want to sweep their luck and fortune out the house either when the new year has just begun.

are there any new year custom in your countries?
please share for more information and correct this post help me.

i was listening to the radio last night and a song started to be played.
"jo" means "an area." but since 1980s or 90s in japan, when the word, "gerende" was somehow introduced, and when ski resort companies used "gerende" to refer to their ski area and advertise it as a place to find a new love, people have associated "gerende" with their image of finding their love.
so, the japanese word, "gerende" carries all these histories and images in itself.

the rest of topics of the negotiations are already very advanced.
both parties agree on the creation of two governments, a provisional one in belgium led by puigdemont aimed at internationalizing the catalan cause, and the other one in barcelona led by someone else aimed at starting a constituent process to create the new catalan constitution.
in addition, erc proposes to implement measures in order grow social support for independence which would allow the new administration to take unilateral steps to confront spain in the future.
jxcat filed a proposal to reinstate deposed government yesterday without reaching an agreement with erc.
it also refuses the repression and the direct rule over catalonia carried out by the spanish government over the past few months.
last week, erc refused to support a proposal to amend the presidency law presented by jxcat in order to allow puigdemont to swear in as president with enough guarantees.
this move together with other disagreements was seen as hostile by jxcat which decided to suspend the negotiations with erc last wednesday.
jxcat and erc restarted their negotiations on the formation of a new government yesterday morning.
while jxcat contends that puigdemont must be able to control the catalan government from brussels, erc argues that it would lead to a confrontation with the spanish government that they want to prevent by any means.

it was a discovery for me to know that some famous songs are covers of the less popular original songs.
for example, the song by nancy sinatra "bang bang" is the cover of the cher's song.
the song by sinead o'connor "nothing compares 2u" is also the cover of early prince's musical project "the family".

the major problem was vatican state.
the new premier of kingdom of italy was ricasoli.
the fourth war italian independence it part, in a sence and at the beginning, to the wider conflit austro-prussian, that italy represented the western front.
austria ceded, after the defeat to the prussia, veneto to the france.
in this way he was cutting the supples from austria came to the austrian army in verona and trent.
in 1865 florence became the capital of italy.
they were near the alps, a natural italian border, but everything stopped for political reasons.
this one word became the motto of risorgimento, and the symbol of discipline and devotion of garibaldi.
the original of the telegram is in the national archive in roma.
it remained to conquer the vatican state.
already the romans talked about alps as a border, then they conquered other territories and they created the imperium.
it's difficult to summarise the fourth war of italian independence, because there were the alliances and yours breakups between austria, prussia, france and italy.
he said, about the vaican state, 'a free church in a free state', 'absolute freedom of the church' to reassure the catholic italians.
egli said just roma is the capital of italy.

they've been living happily until the day he suddenly died.
days have passed and her heart is still with him.
she wishes he would somehow come back at her door so that they could start living together like they always did, but she knows that won't happen.
she walks around and sees him in every little thing she sees, but her dream is the only place she can hold his hands, which she does every night.
i've never had an experience like this, so tried my best to imagine how it would feel to have someone you love die all of a sudden and be left alone.
as someone who wants to be a vocalist that can really connect to listeners emotions one day, i needed to put a lot of effort to follow the girl's emotions to really sing the song.
i worry about him.
he seems to have some trouble.
i hope i could help him.
it's a annual event, too.
i and my colleagues had to prepare next semester for welcoming new students.
it's a annual event.
on the other hand, i will be very nervous in three month.
i am concerned about the student's every action.
i am just thinking about whether new students understand the content of the lecture, whether the speed of my speaking is too fast or whether it is too small when i write on the blackboard.
the last post was back in 2011.
i use english everyday but only with children up to 12 years old.

it has taken a bit long time since i had met one of them last time.
he was dating with a women when we met last time where we had a bbq party.
he is not so young, maybe around 40.
so, i have guessed that he and his girl friend will get married soon.
i asked him when they will get married last night.
i was surprised and ask him why he and his girl friend broke up.
he answered the question.
his girl friend had returned to her hometown, fukuoka prefecture.
they came to a conclusion that they broke up because it would be difficult to continue long-distance relationship.
i hope he can find a new and last women to be dating soon.
i have never had a serious sickness in my life.
my chronic disease is hay fever,rhinitis and nut allergy.

i bought ten pieces of naoigire for ocarina members.
i hope naoigire will bring happy things to them.
today i was almost driven mad by my supplier.
two days ago i got an order from my customer.
before i confirmed the order i negotiated with my supplier.
i asked him if the former price was okay and he confirmed.
so i sent the quotation to my customer and they confirmed.
however, when this order went through the next step, i asked my supplier for an official document with stamp.
he stopped replying me.
after few calls from him, today he finally told me.
the former price was not acceptable at this time.
he wanted an increase of 29% of the former price otherwise the factory was not willing to do it.
even him was embarrassed.
he told me he would try to solve this problem.
why not he negotiate with factory earlier and told me everything before i confirm order with my customer.
now the order has already been confirmed, how can i ask for an increase of money?
and it's a customer who cooperated with us for the first time.
how can i recall my words.
don't know what to do next now.
after a congress at hokkaido, i came to shin-chitose airport.
i scheduled to go home at 23:00, but the flight was cancelled because of a heavy snow.
i and one of the participants of the congress, who reserved a seat on the same flight with mine, went to the spa of the airport, and took a rest until this morning.
although my schedule was disturbed, but it was interesting and exiting experience for me!
when i stood in front of the poetic tablet of yun dong-ju with the poem "prologue" carved into it,* which begins with "wishing not to have so much as a speck of shame toward heaven until the day i die," i felt a lump in my throat, and my eyes almost watered.
* should i say "on it"?
i went to doshisha university to see the memorial stones of yun dong-ju and jeong ji-yong.
when i stood in front of the poetic tablet of yun dong-ju with one of his poems "prologue" carved into it,* which begins with "wishing not to have so much as a speck of shame toward heaven until the day i die," i felt a lump in my throat and my eyes almost watered.

beef, and norman conquest of england
when i was a high school student, i didn't used to be keen on the history.
i didn't like the history of europe especially, because they seemed to be extremely complicated both geologically and historically.
there seems to be a plenty of henry i and william ii and someone like that anywhere and anytime of history.
the boundaries change continuously and drastically, and therefore i wasn't able to keep track of the historical persons or events at all.
however, recently i happened to know about a norman conquest in the 11th century and found it interesting.
according to the article i read, during this period the english language changed a lot into the present style english.
without the norman conquest, english may be intricate, difficult language to learn like german or other germanic languages.
i studied german as second foreign language when i was a college student, and couldn't feel like i could master it at all.
a interesting anecdote about the norman conquest is about the languages they used in that era.
the aristocrats used french while anglo-saxons used english, therefore, because mainly the former ate and the latter produced, the word cow has become to be called beef when they are regarded as food in english.
that has been my nagging question of all time.

i've spent much time watching olympic games past a couple weeks.
i've never watched this much games before because of time differences.
i don't do any winter sports myself but watching the games are really exciting!
i'm getting to know about it but still the strategies are too complicated to understand.
also, i wonder what's the point of throw 8 times in each end, because the opponent move your stones and back to square one so easily and i feel like only the last a few slidings determine the outcome.
there is the last game tonight so i want to learn about the strategy more in detail.

whenever i watch videos in which people describe an artificial intelligence world we will be living in and how convenient and intelligent life will be.
my feelings are that it always takes ages for those claims to come true should they will come true, but by the time that era comes i will have died already why should i give a fag.
i would never try to paint such a beautiful pic of the life i will have in the future just base on the fantasies and wild guesses people make.
i'm grow cold by lame act and unnatural situation of tv dramas.
a:there is no tears in the actor's eyes, but they plays a cry in tv drama.
also in some scene, the actor only silent sob without cry out at the moment of his friends death.
some character who just woke up from sleep but they can begin to do something smoothly.
these terrible acting make me to return from the world of tv drama world to the real world.
when yesterday i talked to one of my language partners, she already back to her family house, and she would meet her boyfriend there, duaring spring festival, she had been her hometown, and her boyfriand came back to his family home.
i know that she will get married wiht her boyfriend next year, and her parrents met his parents to talk about the wedding ceremnoy last year, and they nust be going to hold a marirage ceremony next year, then, she already proposed to bank loann and had taken out loan with the bank, their new apartment will build by the end of this year, surprisingly, i didn't expect thet she got married with her boydriend in her hometown so soon like this, she has just made a mariadge contrast there, marriadge ceremony wil be held next year.
i asked when her marriadge ceremoni would hold, she didn't know when, she is just depending her parents.
she used to say that she and her boyfriend don't pay any money but her boyfriand's parents should pay most of it.
it seems to me that they don't have much of a say in something to their bridal.
i was working a part-time job at a bakery when i was a student.
until then, i had never worked a part-time job,so everything happened was fresh,exciting and fun.
the smell of fresh-baked bread stimulated not only our customers but also our stomach.
especially, a fresh-baked white bread could be sold out soon.
on fridays, in addition, little sleep is usually given, despite accumulated fatigue.

how and why are stereotypes are formed?
it could be unbeneficial because it keeps us from getting to know who they really are.
media is just the main means of mass communication with an anonymous face.
in this season, many people are enjoying watching olympic game on tv every day.
after japanese athletes get gold medals, the rules have often been changed.
it is very nice room, so i may keep going back to this room for a while.
pcr is a very basic experimental method which is used in variety fields.
one of the tips of pcr is not to add too much dna template in the first place.
this sounds preposterous because it is obvious that the more original dna is, the more augmented dna they obtain.
however, dna sample sometimes contain substances which impede enzymes to replicate dna.
thus, when you do pcr, you have to meticulously examined the appropriate experimental condition in advance.
do not make light of pcr even though it is just a rudimentary experiment.
i have written this down to buckle myself down.
nowadays, i have failed pcr over and over again wasting time.
i don't have any plan for this weekend.
the first half of last year, i would wake up very early and take a train at around 6 am for commuting, and last half of the year, i shifted the time of getting on a train by one hour in order to get more time for sleeping.
and again, i am considering to change time to go to bed and get up.
i need to learn time management as well as objectives management.

can you read this word of the title?
i captured curious about the word's meaning and its origin even though i wrote it myself.
the definition of "guardian" is not necessarily only parents.
as you may know, every words and phrase have the most suitable genre of writings respectively in which they should be used.
i am not that sure if the first english translation exactly means the ancient japanese sentence, and i couldn't even translate the second one into english.

i am learning a lot about my mother tongue day by day together with you.
the thing he said to me was not necessarily wrong.
i mentioned, "in the modern japanese language." it implies that this word had been used with totally different meaning in the ancient japanese language.
ana-gachi meant "aggressively, forcibly, sincerely" in the ancient japanese.
can't we forcibly stop cherry blossoms fallen from trees?

tips to get a comfortable place on a crowded train in tokyo.
tips are based on my experience.
i hope these tips help you.
place you wait to train
if you there is any station you often use for a commute or other things, you would better check the number of the car you suppose to get off.
that helps you get off smoothly.
what's more, you need to check the stairs where you suppose people would go, after they get off the train.
with that information, you can choose the place you wait.
perhaps you think waiting in right or left line is insignificant but this tip is extremely useful.
if you wait in the other line, you would have to wait in the line because people keeping getting off aiming to stairs.
go inside or go at the end
near the doors tends to make a traffic jam and you'll be stuck if you stay there, so you'd better go inside especially in front of chairs as it is spacious.
if you are going to use special trains which do not stop many stations such as commuter-special-rapid, and if you are not staying in the first of a waiting line, it's good to drop at last.
as i mentioned, near door is a crowded place but if there are not so many stops it's a good place compared to stuck among people near doors.
for getting a seat you'd better be a detective!
honestly, i do not good at detecting the person who gets off faster, but i'm sure if you could find the person and stay in front of the person, you would get the seat.
to be an early bird
just it!

i become naive in good way.
i studied english and math in order to pass the exam.
my essay.
from the age of the ancient states, to the 21st century, so many people have been fighting constantly to be respected their minimum basic rights and freedoms, and demonstrated that the guarantee of human rights is the basis for justice and peace in our society.
the ignorance of basic human rights has brought such terrible histories as like the holocaust and 731 units, and the humane aspiration for assurance of humane value and equality has greatly influenced the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights.
as the role of the government for ensuring human rights has become significant, provisions about guarantee of human rights have been described in the constitution of many countries, and inside the society, activities for helping minority groups have increased.
from the mid-15th century to the beginning of the 20th century, ghana was colonized and abused by western powers such as portugal and the netherlands, and early realized on the importance of guarantee of human rights while suffering from innumerable damages from slave trade.
this awareness led to the first independence in sub - saharan africa in 1960.
ghana appreciates and sympathizes with all moral and humanitarian efforts for the guarantee of fundamental human rights, and still working hard to provide the equal treatment for the minority group by supporting those who are still discriminated.
just as many other countries in the world have done, the prime role of ghana's prison was the accommodation of political prisoners by the coup, and even some of them were exploited in harsh circumstance when kwame nkrumah grouped cacao farms to mobilize private funds
the prisoners are isolated from society and must be responsible for their past, but they will someday return to society and live as equal people
therefore, ghana's prison has been focusing on their reformation and providing various support for their effective reintegration into society.
we would like to say that governments should pay attention to the rights of women and disabled people in the prison camp further from the improvement of treatment of simple prisoners.
ghana concentrates on the implementation of the legislation that protects women and children from dangerous traditional practices such as the fgm, implements a women quota in the composition of the prisons service council, and provides nursing homes and foster care facilities for the welfare of women prisoners.
despite the fact that fair prison policies and rules are being enacted and implemented, however, ghana 's circumstance of imprisonment are in poor condition, and still exists relative distance from the prison system of developed countries.
ghana believes that the guarantee of social people and civilian-governmental humanitarian efforts towards to minority groups will ultimately lead to a virtuous cycle of future society.
and we finally hope that other countries in africa will take care of the importance of ensuring the humane rights of minority groups or those who needs to be re-socialized, such as the prisoners, together with us.
we all know how hard to start a new language.
i have almost worked as a teacher in different types of schools, including kindergartens, primary schools and junior high schools.
in my brief teaching career i prefer first-hand experience because i want students to study more than those in classes and text books.
therefore, i have made a survey from which it is concluded that boring textbooks fails to attract them.
given that conclusion, i have changed the way of teaching and put multimedia into use, in order to guide them to learn gradually in context the way chinese students do.
moreover, i will show them more about chinese culture like chinese paper-cutting, calligraphy and chinese songs.
ever since i was in school.
start learning a new language is hard for beginner.
but i find exciting ways to teach.
make my own slides and learning chinese culture events.
like chinese paper-cut, writing, songs and making dumplings in class.
in short, it shifts the focus from teaching a subject to teaching the students.
therefore, one who makes it possible for a kid to learn even if he is different.
it's take about 10 minute.
my commute is used my car for 30 minuets.
i always listen to the podcast which is news programs.
the podcast is more interesting than tv shows,because there are a lot of comment or opinions.
also the good point is updated every day.
my brother sent an email to me.
he said, "i will ask mum about a spring break plan."
i suggest to him how about going to onsen.
i am glad if she would want to go there.
however if it is onsen, she might do not mind to go.
i think it is too important to have decent clothes and livings.
i have a dream to make gracious and classy living.
i promise you to fulfill my dreams.
his mistake was intentional.
the other day, the us president donald trump met several survivors of the gun shooting massacre in florida to lend an ear to the victims' voices in person.
when he seated himself on the chair, he grabbed a reminder sheet in his hands.
also, the phrase sometimes has a slight nuance like, 'i understand your opinion and position, but i won't totally agree with you.' this is because the speaker doesn't listen to but hear you.
when he seated himself on the chair, he grabbed a reminder sheet in his hands.
actually, this was the first time for me to learn this english phrase, so i looked it up in the online dictionary.
it seems that the expression shows someone your agreement or empathy without any particular intention in the daily life.
also, the phrase sometimes has a slight nuance like, 'i understand your opinion and position, but i won't totally agree with you.' this is because the speaker doesn't listen to but hear you.
is that worth being a reminder point to potus?
what do you think it would be good topics for it?
i expect that they'll bring up olympic's games.
what kind of competitions so you focus on?
which scene are you impressed?
it has been stoping snow for three days but it starts snowing again just now.
it has been stoping snow for three days but it starts snowing again just now.
so, i'll try to learn some questions in advance.
what kind of competitions so you focus on?
which scene are you impressed?
i'll think of my answer while i'm driving.
it has been stoping snow for three days but it starts snowing again just now.
i was told that, but i actually have a mixed feeling.
english is a language that mediates my native language and other languages.
it was easy.
i sensed someone came and heard the person chatting with the salesman.
the other day, i saw packed unfamiliar fish in the fish section in the basement of a department store.
it was easy.
i sensed someone came and heard the person chatting with the salesman.
then the second man told us to grill them without sprinkling salt.
if you find it's not salty enough after grilling, you can put soy sauce or something to adjust taste.
i grilled the fish as it was the next day, and it tasted good.
if i had sprinkled salt, it would have been too salty.
thank you for your advice, the person who puts on brilliant red lipstick.
i want to be with him as long as possible in spite of his getting old.
"this is style what i like"
it's a long time which i didn't login this website.
i think it must be too lazy for me.
it need have a big determination to spend time to learn english everyday.
despite me having grown up in a tight, warm family, i was quite a lone wolf...
both of them never understood the beauty hidden in reading.
my father never understood the reason why i was reading books, and always tried to convince me on giving up on books.
in contrast, my mother was a well-talked woman.
she climbed the social ladder rather quickly after marrying my father, from what she told me, and ended working in a reputable mansion, under an extremely beautiful noble lady.
but as i entered the mansion and met elina's eyes i felt a shock traveling through my body.
she had small, curly lips, and a black, deep iris.
she must have been known through the country...
i can't say things i don't mean at all because i feel these are kinds of lies.
i think people should tell truth from flatterers, but hearing flatterers may make them feel comfort.
i'm never nice, especially to men, but i think that i'm also honest to everyone, considering i never tell a lie.
in the past, i've commented how a lot of british series used to be transmitted in latin america during my childhood.
i don't know, maybe that's one of the reasons i like london.
one of those series that left a great impression in me was "enemy at the door", that was about the occupation of one of the channel island, the only british territory that fall under the nazi regime during wwii.
in my juvenile ignorance, i thought those were remote island, maybe close to the falklands, and not between england and europe, although i must confess that my mistake made the situation more interesting.
i deeply enjoy those old series, filmed in studio with few cameras.
they have a feeling of "telenovela", but with a worthy content.
so, it was a pleasure to find that series available in the library of the congress.

i forget to leave it.
as associated symptoms, increasing pulse rate, respiration rate, and heart beat are observed.
however, when i think about the relationship of body heat and blood vessels, vessels are expended by high body temperature.
while i was studying, i had a question regarding blood pressure.
a patient sweats.
sweating causes dehydration in the patient's body, so that ability of oxygen supply to cells decreases.
in this process, tachypnea is often seen on the patient due to the deficiency of oxygen.
as associated symptoms, increasing pulse rate, respiration rate, and heart beat are observed.
however, when i think about the relationship of body heat and blood vessels, vessels are expended by high body temperature.
it means, wider vessels reduce the pressure of blood flow.
then, how does fever cause higher blood pressure?
i really don't understand why my listening skills will be improved.
i determined that i practice a lot every night.
what do you think of it?
a japanese lady is missing.
a 27-year-old japanese lady from hyogo prefecture has been missing since in the middle of this month.
a 26-year-old american man was arrested because he confined the lady to a room of b&b in osaka.
security camera caught them entering the building, but later, he came out alone with a big bag.
the police has been looking for the lady, but she's still missing.
i often say when you wonder whether you should do or not, it's better to do, because if you didn't do, nothing would happen.
however, i think young people meet people too soon after they encounter on the internet.
of course, even if we dated a girlfriend or boyfriend for a long time, we would realize they are different from our thoughts after getting married, though.
sometimes they misunderstand what we intend to say, and it may cause of the argument.
i'm not discouraging you to make friends on the internet, but i think it's better to exchange messages to see what kind of people they are before you meet in person.
i hope she will be found alive as soon as possible!

this sentence was what i tried.
a car crash accident
i'm alive, but struggled by lots of work and some serious health problems.
also i still recovering from a shock i've got after getting experienced with a terrible car crash accident i had last weekend that constantly ruined my mental health.
the day started very lovely.
i was exciting because of my upcoming fencing training and seeing my friends tonight.
there was extremely cold and snowing heavily and my friends and i were heading to the forest to take some winter pictures.
we were listening to our favorite music, joking and talking about our plans and nothing presaged any disaster.
but then i felt that something wrong happened with the car.
and then the driver started to lose control.
we have to make an emergency stop and tried to get out of the car but the doors were jammed..
i was terrified and frantically tried to open the door, but it was unsuccessful.
i wanted to call for help, but my phone turned off because it was too cold.
i felt incredibly anxious and hysterical.
i literally thought i was going to die.
my chest tightened and i felt unable to breathe.
and i finally understood, that i can't control my body anymore because i was derealized.
i stopped feeling any cold and couldn't move a muscule.
after 2 hours of experiencing of this terrifying condition i heard the voices of my friends, who tried to wake me up and get me out of car.
the help finally arrived, but i was frozen and unable to move.
they put me onto back seat of the car and we went home.
the realization that death was so close was driving me crazy.
i couldn't eat and sleep for 2 days and it was really hard to countine my studing.
now i don't feel such an anxiety that i felt before, but my health is getting worse day by day...
i'm afraid that i urgenly need to get medical attention befote it's too late..
some things as clothes, books, plates, music, movies and another type of things.
maybe i need to sell or give to another people some things, because i don't need those any more.
if i only have that type of things i'm going to clean my house and my life.
i had used a pc cooler since i bought my current main pc.
recently, it made noise a little so i bought new one:
using the fun, the temperature goes down to about 40 degrees c.
arenius equation says that when the temperature goes up 10 degrees c then its life goes to half.
i use the fun expecting to extend the life of my main pc.
my previous main pcs were broken for around 4 years and i use the main pc for 3 and half year and on time is about 17k hours.
if i can use the pc for two years from now, i think the fun might be effective.

i made my dress using a used-kimono.
this dress pattern has a short sleeve pattern, but i changed the sleeves three-quarter length with ruffles from conventional sleeves.
it's still as cold as ever, so i added the sleeve length by a few inches.
i think the dress goes well with boots and fur vest as a casual style.
i am often asked by people, "how to make a garment from a kimono?" it's gonna be a long story, so i'll tell you another time.
in conclusion.
i made my dress using a used-kimono.
it's still as cold as ever, so i added the sleeve length by a few inches.

my favorite teacher at school
my favorite teacher at school was the natural science teacher, her class was very entertaining and i remembered that she left us a lot of homework such drawing or cutting off images of animals, plants and part of cell.
and also i had a book with all records of newspaper and magazines.
and finally i remembered that her class contains poster stuck on the wall of animals, plants and planetary sistem.
in this letter, the signatories complain that governments, education ministers, and the editorial boards of newspapers anxiously await the results of pisa, which are cited authoritatively in countless policy reports, and these have begun to influence the educational practices in many countries.
in addition, these experts emphasize that pisa is an organ of the oecd and this is an organization that, by its nature and objectives, will always hypertrophy the role of economics in education.
the other is that the report is made by specialists in psychometrics, statistics and economics.
pisa gives us data on the academic development of the countries, however some governments use that data poorly and become obsessed.
exams are important tools to evaluate, but they become a problem when they become an end in itself, because education is not about preparing students to pass exams but preparing them for life.
can you please check these sentenses below, which is about "my staying in london and dublin"?
for london, i had lived there for 9 month in 2016 to
after studying in london, i moved to dublin as working holiday last june.
i was studying english for first 3 months in a language school and then i got a teaching job in a small language school.
i got 5 irish students who were complete begginers.
in the school, there were no teaching stuff like textbooks so i had to prepare them by myself.
although preparing the class was a bit tough, there were good students, who were studying really hard.
during the holiday, i hanged out friends and we went to some cities such as belfast, galway, alan irland etc.
it was great fun and i enjoyed myself so i miss those days.
once upon a time in a magic forest, two friends that they were very close,because since they were a children spend time together.
they used to play together in the forest for hours; they liked to climb trees, annoy fairies and play hidding with the animals.
althougt they were different physically, they had a lot of thing in common, they enjoy to be together.
she was a beautiful and tendernes princess, and he was a small, green gnomus with a gorgeous smile.
they both live separated by a river that cross the forest.
to cross the river was a really dangerous for them, for the strong watercourses, so they dreamed to buil a brige that united the both territories, this will benefit them and to habitants of the town.
important economists have declared that the most of people will live in big cities, and small villages will be depopulated in 15 years.
but nowadays, a lot of families have thought about moving into rural areas because of the huge benefits which it involves.
if you are planning to have a change of air and live in a countryside, you should continue reading.
the most important one is that your health will impove in a short period of time, because of the atmosphere is cleaner and the air is less polluted.
another point of wiew in favour of living in the country you may easily buy a house is cheaper than to buy one in a city.
in fact, there will be plenty of space to built a mansion and you can have garden or even swimming pool.
however, there are some disadvantages whitch you may take into account.
for instance, living in the country is slower.
on the other hand, people there do not earn so much money and find a job is quite more difficult.
in addition, the access to shops you can have in the city is different in the country.
to sum up, living in the country may have a lot of advantages such as fresh air or less trafic.
however, a lot of people decide to stay in the city, due to the life in the town is easier.
altought, if you are retired and you need a relaxed life it can be an attractive option.

a joke. a crazy murderer
they immediately call their headquarters and talk with their boss who asks what has happened.
they explain to him that a woman killed her husband; she first had stabbed him twelve times, shot twice, cut his head off then burned his body.
"yes, she said that her husband had come into the kitchen while she was washing the floor."
it has been a long time i write anything here.
i assumed that so many friends might be left the site.
in the late 1950s, suburbicon is a small suburban community, where families, only white and middle class, enjoy a quiet life in pretty detached houses.
when the mayers move into their home, the postman thinks they are furniture movers, because there are not afro-american dwellers in the area.
their neighbours are shocked, too, and immediately build high fences to be separated from them.
the family lodge, composed of gardner, rose and their son nicky, is not so close-minded.
from their patio, rose, who became disabled after a car accident, and her twin sister margaret, who often takes care of her, feel pity for young andy mayer alone in his backyard, and they push nicky to play with the kid.

i get many ideas when i finished it.
the smaller aim is, the better you will do.
because you'r not willing to do it if the work seem to be a lot or spend a lot of time at first.
but in the end, most of them will be stoping far away from finished.
as i read over the book, i finally find the answer that i set aims too big.
these lines are what one of gintama characters, sinpachi, said.
he told these his sister, tae, who was made to get married with the head of a elite clan, kyuubei.
this is because his dad and other members of the clan raised her as a boy.
tae's been a strong womam, who never show her weakness.
they both grew up together and kyuubei was admire her.
kyuubei said to tae, "if i become a strong samurai with a big heart, will you get marry me?".
even when you're hurt or want to cry, forcing yourself to smile.
always without saying anything to anyone, you bear the burden alone, decid alone and end up smiling alone.
he told these his sister, tae, who was made to get married to the head of a elite clan, kyuubei.
gintama takes place in old japan with futuristic civilization.
in old japan, the head who succeeds their households was always a man.
tae's been a strong womam, who never shows her weakness.
funny moments on this part:
even when you're hurt or want to cry, forcing yourself to smile.
always without saying anything to anyone, you bear the burden alone, decid alone and end up smiling alone.
if you're hurt, then just tell us.
these lines are what one of gintama's characters, shinpachi, said.
he told these his sister, tae, who was made to get married to the head of a elite clan, kyuubei.
while gintama characters always try to have viewers laugh, serious scenes always give me goose bumps.
tae's been a strong womam, who never shows her weakness.
today i was in the grim mood because i am ill.
but lately, i have taken some pills and my body temperature has fallen.
it is lugubrious to consider that it will rise again and cause my body to ache.
i feel great frustration that i have caught this disease and cannot even go outdoors.
i hope the owner to hire one more person.
i can not even dream to clean dining area.
i only can pile stock at slow time, nothing else.
i will report this filthy place to health inspector after quit this job.
life is short, so burn it hot!
help me correct the mistake.
my family business internet cafe.
and today i met 2 costomers from russia.
i afraid to communicate with them bacause i not good english.

she grab my hand and tried to see my hand surface of line but after seeing my palm she became a cat and tried to biting me and then i throw away her.
writing it down in a one place makes my understanding deeper and clearer.
all your attempts leads to nothing.
tuned resource is a first state when you start do the right things to get energy from a resource.
if you do it regularly, your energy flow became more and more stable and sustained.
developed state is when you know and easily do many great stuff in resource, get energy from it without efforts, and can shift your attention to other resources when needed.
addiction - is a state in which you overdependent from the particular resource.
in many addictions you identify yourself with ideas or group of people.
you loose yourself.
shopaholics, bodybuilders and gym bunnies trapped into addiction to their image.
addiction here is might be money-grubbing and lust for money.
economics has two pieces- money and living conditions.
they waste their time on information neither for using it in the future, nor for conscious pleasure.
for instance, often young mothers use the word we, saying about the success of their child.
excessive number of trainings.
using strong medications to feel yourself good without medical prescriptions.
love addict fixates himself on particular person.
unimportant or too small in comparison to level of your personality.
workaholics see the world by the lenses of work.
they tend to see the money as a consequences of lots of work.
addiction here is when you dissolve yourself in group of people or merger with a person psychologically.
in addition to that, one of my best friends, who had one, told me that it was worth buying.
they asked many questions, saying "alexa, what is the weather like?", "alexa, who was the first us president?" and "alexa, at what temperature is water boiled?.
i tried doing some things with alexa, but all i do now is just asking her to play music.
what i feel irritated is that she just say "i don't know that" when i can't say something right in english.
as far as my wife is concerned, she asks alexa to count amount of time when she cooks.
i asked the friend who recommended amazon echo to me, for what he uses it, and i found that he also faced the same situation.
olympic!
for these two weeks i've been watching olympic games on tv.
especially, i like figure skating, speed skating, and curling.
in speed skating japanese athletes won some medals.
i can't help crying when i'm watching them struggling to win.
sometimes, or in many cases they can't reach a goal which they've been dreaming and making efforts for.
as in japan many winter sports are not very popular,they sometimes can't find enough number of sponsors.
so after games i heard some athletes saying they didn't know if they would keep trying for another four years even if they themselves wanted to.
i love walking in park.
i would start slow and i will do this maybe 30 minutes a day.
i really enjoy my time while doing this.
actually i went through a time when i felt tired all the time.
even after i slept for 8hours at night, i woke up feeling groggy, tired and wanting to go back to sleep.
it's walking helps me overcome my tiredness.
after doing that, i can even focus on the morning class.
read less than before
people used to read books on the subway in my city, but now most people watch video or play games on their phones.
actually i bought 5 books on amazon last months.
all of them lay unopen.
i spent most of my leisure time on my phones.
in the front of the restaurant, they showed the price list, but it was lunch menu's price.
i wonder it they intended us to get more money.
other customers were also asking about the price at casher.
i never go to the restaurant anymore.
in the front of the restaurant, they showed the price list, but it was lunch menu's price.
i wonder it they intended us to get more money.
i never go to the restaurant anymore.
my daughter and i went to a buffet restaurant tonight.
i wonder it they intended us to get more money.
i never go to the restaurant anymore.
should teachers get their gun?
every time a gun shooting tragedy occurred in the us, each president would refer to the necessity of the gun control policies.
i'm dubious whether all of them worried about the problem in earnest, but at least they 'appeared' to think about it.
yesterday, i was totally surprised to hear the news that mr trump officially claimed more teachers should hold their gun at school in order to avoid criminals from approaching their students.
he went so far as to say that armed teachers should be rewarded some bonus.
she fiercely criticized a lot of politicians, including trump, financially supported by the nra, though her emotional voice apparently didn't deliver to the oval office.
come to think of it, michael moore, who produced a controversial film titled 'bowling for columbine' in 2002, should make the sequel documentary with a candid interview towards donald trump.
i spoke with my boss after work and i told him i will leave my office next month.
i feel terribly sorry but i think it is necessary to improve my programming skill.
please let me know your valuable opinions and suggestions about the translation.
in the eye-catching figure skating competition, japanese skater yuzuru hanyu, previously suffering through injury, again competed against top skaters form all over the world and won the golden medal in the end.
he is the first figure skater that won the olympics champion twice in a row in the past 66 years.
another japanese skater shoma uno earned the silver medal while the previous world champion spanish skater javier fernandez took the bronze medal.
i reserved a apartment in this trip.
i thought that the house would be small for 5 people, it wasn't,it very fit for us.
when we arrived at the apartment then we realized that the apartment was pretty good, surrounded with mountain and tree, a very quiet place and more important things that all of us have a bed, it is awesome to me.
i'm going to tell them "group activity".
they always like to belong to some groups so that they can be relieved with having a sense of solidarity "i'm not alone".
as a result of it, they look all similar, their clothes and hairstyle.....
of course, they assert their personality but it doesn't stand out in such an environment where all is heading in the same direction.
i think it will be better for student to choose a major field of study wait until the second or the third year.
i don't think that many students know what exactly they want to study before they go to a university or a college.
actually many people are adrift of what they want to do with their life.
but months later, i realized i am not interested in it at all.
i hate reading mountains of cases.
i was so depressed everyday.
also since i began speaking english, i had many opportunities to talk with many foreign friends as well.
i also met some american people, and i talked about a relationship between america and the uk with some american friends and british friends.
the first time, i thought this is quite strange that both of them are complaining each other.
i was wondering why do they hate each other.
because they're kinda kinship.
but one day my american friend told me that around 18th century, there was a war between america and the uk and eventually america left the uk and that day is called "independence day".
i assume that this history is quite famous but personally i didn't know this incident.
so i slightly made sense that they don't like each other.
i think it is because japan doesn't have any relationship like between america and the uk so i can't even imagine that we have another nation that speaks japanese.
however, i do say it is sad that they don't like their kind of kinship.
and eventually, they said 'even though british people said it's "a proper english", i don't afford it and ours is better".
on the contrary, british people said "their slangs are cheesy, and our english is way better and "proper" '.
a pop singer came to the 80th anniversary celebration of my high school.
i still remembered that the students kept screaming during his performance.
at the end of the performance, many students were so excited that they threw their stuffs into the air and rushed to the stage.
all you can drink until 120 minutes!
today i couldn't access the computer my disk.
i thought it might be the problem of cable, so i decided to buy a new one today.
i wanted to come early and back to home early, so i set my arlam clock at seven.
the shops selling settings rewarding computer are nearly all closed, be the chinese new year is coming soon, they all come back to their hometown.
i saw only one opened shop.
the clerks call me in.
they bought me a new cable and try it in their own computer, but it failed anyhow.
the clerk thought i might buy a fake disk.
it's difficult to tell only by the appearance of it.
finally i bought a new one which costs 400 yuan.
today i couldn't access the computer my disk.
i thought it might be the problem of cable, so i decided to buy a new one today.
they bought me a new cable and try it in their own computer, but it failed anyhow.
it turned that his guess was right.
finally i bought a new one which costs 400 yuan.
i washed curtain today.
last year, i had a chain problem and this time, my bicycle had a brake problem.
since the sounds of the brakes were very loud, some people turned around and tried to see what happened to me.
i thought that i caused a noise problem, so i finally went to a bicycle shop to get my bicycle fixed.
the shop owner was very good at his work, so it took him only five minutes to put oil on the parts of brakes and checked the other parts of my bicycle.
my husband and i went to hokkaido to take pictures of steam locomotive.
it was 3 nights 4 days trip.
i checked in hotel at 20:30.
and i feel really disappointed that i couldn't tell my idea clearly.
i usually look up to someone who can speak foreign language fluently.
though i've learned english and chinese for years, my language skill especially in speaking is still poor.
because i've worked trading company now, there are a lot of opportunities to communicate with foreign people.

i have few opportunities to use english after i graduated from university.
my current job doesn't requires any english skills, so i don't have to study english.
having been studied for a long time, that is waste.
and i'm thinking about quitting my current job and get a job that requires english skills.
i have less time after working but i'll try to continue studying again and improving my english skills.
i read two books for the past two weeks, and it was quite fun.
by the way, i bought a book when i was in the uk, but i haven't finished it because reading books in english takes forever.
this is my new resolution of this year!
moreover, this bad effect lasts next day.
i think staying awake late is against the human nature.
i can concentrate my work.
why learn grammar
there are four different traits about grammar.
firstly, it's the knowledge about language.
secondly, it's the ability to use language.
thirdly, it's a rule that helps us talk about language.
fourthly,it's the attitude and mindset or the way of thinking about language.
we can usually "do" grammar automatically because we have gained tons of knowledge about it since our childhood.
if our ability of grammar is weak, people around us might feel uncomfortable with it and take a lot of energy to understand us even worse, have a bias against us.
if you know about grammar well, you can convey your thoughts clearly and other people trust you well.
pain is partly similar to weather
to save energy in our everyday life we should use water economically
i like shiina ringo which is a musician of japan.
she directed promotion of tokyo olympic in rio olympic closing ceremony.
her music has special air and i especially love her song's lyrics.
painting school
today i went to my painting school to show my last piece of my current course.
i have been making starting it over four times, and i am fed up with it.
so, before going to school, i had made up my mind if she wouldn't like my fourth design, i would change the whole things in the design.
i was very happy even though i still have to work on it.
i think i probably will start my last course in spring.
i just can't wait!
are there any good sysonyms to the phrase:
are there any good sysonyms to the phrase:
this argument could be partially correct; however, it seems that the role of the extended family remains crucially in some asian countries, such as japan and china.
in eastern asian society, there is a trend that the birth rate decreases over year, as many families have only one or no child.
even in china, there is a one-child policy lasting from the 1980s to 2017.
cousins could be the closet play partners for the 'only children's childhood.
during my childhood and puberty, i frequently suffered from loneliness as many other 'only children' did.
we spent a plenty of time together just like siblings.
the similar situation exists widely in only child families.
moving from children to elders, the aged people may face a problem that nobody takes care of them because they have only one or without any children.
in japan, it is a significant social issue of elders without children.
in that case, the relatives, in an extended family, could be very critical to take care of each other and help others when they have difficulties.
although the asian countries have shifted to individualized society in a certain level, traditional culture still plays a vital role in the society.
we can easily find high quantities of family-own business in regions, such as hk.
looking at the structure of the family own business, we can find out that those enterprises mainly base on extended families.
the role of the extended family may vary from countries to countries.
in some western society, the extended families might have become less important.
however, the extended families still are very significant in the asian society.
one of students of our english class talked us her travel to spain.
a: i stayed four night six days in spain.
a: with my three friend.
a: of course, it was sagrada familia of world heritage.
b: by the way, how much was the travel cost?

where did you go in spain?
b: how does the time difference between japan and spain?
a: tokyo is eight hours ahead from madrid.
a: of course, it was sagrada familia of world heritage.
i absolutely recommend you!
b: by the way, how much was the travel cost?
suddenly,i felt lethargy today.
i couldn't understand it reason.
i should probably change my thinking.
suddenly,i felt lethargy today.
i got a book bill, which i bought online the other day, but i forgot to pay it, so i paid it at a convenience store today.
right now, i'm busy with my work and don't have time to read it.
now, i'm watching the olympic games with my wife.
it's curing game.
it's very exciting game.
unfortunately, i couldn't take a pay leave afternoon.
but i left on time which was a good progress to me.
because my eyes hurt very much.
i may well get an eye sickness.
i might well go to see an eye doctor.
today i seat near to a big monitor for watching my excel sheets clearly and protecting my eyes.
sometimes i wonder were they really working in the daytime?
i started to doubt that.
i was sure they had a good relationship so that they can work together smoothly.
i have not interested it and i don't want to work on these because skill is the only thing i can trust.
never ever make friends with your co-worker which is one of my job bibles.
everyone hates it when someone cut them off on the highway.
if i hadn't seen it on internet, i wouldn't have known.
yesterday, i listened to the slowest song ever and almost fell asleep on it.
being the most motivated, we were chattering in italian almost always.
i had made a hard training n ajaccio.
the following year, in privas, i had experience.
my students that i taught from one class to another for 4 years,were learning a lot.
what more could i have asked?

it's been a long time since i've posted an easygoing journal.
as you know if you see my journals, i tend to post serious, dark and heavy journals.

however, i've posted easygoing journals sometimes.
most of them were the ones in which i wrote about situations where i had been for drinks with my friends.

i drink a lot of lovely beer, have much funny conversation with my friends and forget my pain for a little while.
walking on the rails which someone laied for you.
i quote a famous phrase below.
don't walk on the rails which someone laid for you.
this phrase means that you can not become truly happy while you are spending a life which someone expect.
your parents expect that you graduate a top-notch university and enter a big company despite your true dream which you want to become a professional soccer player.
if you choose the way your parents expect for living up their expectation, your pain begins.

so, when i die, bury me into a tree
just thinking of that, i have already overwhelmed by happiness

i like to watch carling.
it looks easy to play but throwing techniques and making a best strategy each ends are important.

i have been asking my coworkers about their thought of our company's problems.
there are two of the biggest problems of the company's president.

i am not sure how the gun control pans out in the united states.
the gun industry in the us is way bigger than the gun control movement and the industry has been lobbying from a long time ago.
this is what makes me be afraid of just jumping into a conversation without fearing any consequences, as you say.
moreover, i often feel i lack words, especially adjectives, and of course phrasal verbs.
i wanted to show off the fabric, i changed the placement of pattern pieces.

choose two quotes, rewrite it, explain why you chose that and how you interpret it.
i completely agree with that quote and i also try to live in that way.
in all life on our way appear many obstacles, many things which cause sadness, pain, disappointment and other these kind of feelings.
many people also cause that feelings, maybe also they want to see our depression but we should hold our head up and smile and go across the life with humor, we should try to stay under and agree on that.
i completely agree with that opinion.
the most important is that we should give someone a hand who needs a help.

you don't need to buy what you don't like, and you send them back with free shipping.
they charge 20 dollars on you as a stylist fee when you order, but the fee will be refunded if you buy at least one product.
i have a dream of becoming a fashion designer.
actually, i also had thought the same way before and i didn't tell anyone.
one day, when i caught up with one of my best friends, i told him my dream for the first time.
honestly, i thought he laughed or made fun of my dream, because i said it like i say a joke to hide embarrassment.
i was afraid to be laughed things i'm series about, and i knew that it wasn't realistic somewhere in my heart.
i couldn't belive in mysel.
besides, i haven't learned fashion design and i don't know about it at all right now.
the response was different than what i thought it would be.
he didn't laugh at me, and belived in me.
when i came back home and cried with happiness alone.
he made me realize that it's okay to say my dream.
after that, i started to say it and no one laughed.
uttering words might help drams come true.
if that's the case no one knows what's going on in the feature, i belive we should go on adventure and do whatever we really want.
i still don't stand at a start line, but i can say i'm heading to my dream.
that's what i used to think, so i didn't tell anyone.
one day, when i was catching up with one of my best friends, i told him my dream for the first time.
my response was different from what i expected.
when i got back home and cried alone with happiness.
i dream of becoming a fashion designer.
telling your dream to someone is pretty embarrassing, isn't it?
however, one of my best friends changed my mindset.
honestly, i thought he would laugh or make fun of my dream, so i said it like a joke to hide my embarrassment.
besides, i haven't learned fashion design and i don't know anything about it at all right now.
he didn't laugh at me, and believed in me.
i was just happy.
when i got back home and cried alone with happiness.
if that's the case no one knows what will happen in the future, but i believe we should go on an adventure and do whatever we really want.
we shouldn't compromise and stay at stable jobs.
sure that we are!
being so intensively interest in politics i read newspapers articles, essays, and books about the field on a daily basis.
the writers always complain the fact that younger people prefer to do other activities but politics.
first of all, i began my analysis by reading different political programmes regarding distinct parties, what caught my attention was the completely absence of the teenagers in their programmes.
secondly, i asked my college mates about politics, this is not a scientific study, of course, but it can give some ideas to plan an action!
for instance new laws with reference to colleges or apprenticeship.
teenagers will be engaged in politics like never!
the boy was looking at me and smiled shortly after i felt in love him lol
i almost kidded him nap lol
he boasted me and showed the star words of mask.
i wanted play with him and absent the school lol
today english is the dominant language a worldwide being spoken by 1.8 billion people across five continents from america to asia.
it is used in a wide variety of fields; from medicine to computing, not surprisingly english is the most popular language to learn.
english is also required in travel and international competitions such as the olympics that are held in english.
we cannot forget the importance of the language in a job research, a good knowledge of english can make a difference to get or not a job.
cultural and economic trends may be dictated by no english-speaking people because the english-speaking countries have lost the power they used to have and their population is less young than the population in the developed countries.
in conclusion, it is true that at the moment english is no.1 as global language used as lingua franca, but its future is uncertain because of cultural and economic changes.
it's been a while since i write in english here for the last time.
i don't have much subjects matters to write, but i will try to write more in english.
do you know that perfect two things exist in this world?
those are the time and the cat.
the cat is extremely special existence that give the artistic beautifulness and a lot of healing to us.
however, at the same time, the cat is also existence like an aristocracy difficult to understand for our humans.
one is provide food to them, and another is to treat affectionately them.
we would not be perhaps able to perfectly understand the cat mind without becoming the cat.
yet one thing is for sure, they've various ideas in regard to everything including the our humans that they own, and always prioritize their own ideas before our ideas.
if a dog jumps into your lap, it is because he is fond of you, but if a cat does the same thing, it is because your lap is warmer than other places.
still, if you want the most noble and beautiful animal of all animals, you should keep the cat.
today, after ten years, i was back there for a swim and i discovered that it is restored and expanded.

the last sunday i was travel with my family to the farm.
we wake up at 5:00 am and it took us two hours to get there.
at the arrive to the farm we unload our things from the car and we strech our legs.
during the rest of the day we had made many activities, like collect beans from the plants, look for blackberries and strawberries, dig up for yucca and collect oranges and lemons.
before the sunset we take the road back, and enjoyed the view from the car.
a day in the farm
the last sunday i was travel with my family to the farm.
in the way we take a break for breakfast.
at the arrive to the farm we unload our things from the car and we strech our legs.
during the rest of the day we had made many activities, like collect beans from the plants, look for blackberries and strawberries, dig up for yucca and collect oranges and lemons.
before the sunset we take the road back, and enjoyed the view from the car.
in the way we take a break for breakfast.
during the rest of the day we had made many activities, like collect beans from the plants, look for blackberries and strawberries, dig up for yucca and collect oranges and lemons.
full steam, i dashed through the low-hanging branches of the tall fir trees, brushing the snow from the twigs as i raced head-to-head against the night.
since my backpack was light and my only additional carry-on items were my pair of skis and a thin rope, i could set a quick pace, and only one hour later, i reached the car park of our inn.
in the valley, there no single trace of snow and the temperatures were mild.
even so everything and every one was preparing for the arrival of winter.
the stockpiles of firewood reached up to the roof of the inn, and on the terrace, which was adjacent to the car park, the parasols, chair and tables had been replaced with ski racks and a metal grid for dirty boots.
a restless wind quickly plucked the last leaves from the trees, which did, however, not fall to the ground but rather flew upwards.
i decided to came back to learning english.
so long time i wrote nothing in english, so i need much time to think what to say.
this is very frustrating but i know very well it is necessary step to learn other language.
recently in japan the people is very enthusiastic about the olympic.
unfortunately i am far from my country so i can't catch up with those movements on time.
especially i really got moved with the beautiful performance of yuduru hanyuu, who won a golden medal in figure skating.
i used to be a person not share my hardships because i think it makes other people worry me, get a negative emotion.
but i was wrong, sharing a pain is not a negative but natural.
and it really works.
two, sit down at my chair, write about what causes strees and how i fix it.
and i often found a quick solution.
three, get sleep.
when i was a student at university in japan, i belonged to a basketball team which have over one hundred students.
last january, we had a party and we were supposed to meet in sannomiya station at six p.m. i was a treasurer.
so i had to go there earlier and collect money for the party from other teammates.
however, i already arrived the station at four thirty.
i went to the cafe to study because i had much time until we met.
i focused on studying too much and forgot looking at time.
then, there were a lot of messages and missed calls from my teammates on my phone.
i held all of my belongings and ran to the station soon.
when i arrived the station, my teammates were collecting money instead of me.
i felt terrible and so sorry for them bothering.
i apologized many times, but they told me it was unusual and forgave me because i had never been late for anything.
i need technique to deal with procrastination.
the next time i have to be punctual, i am going to act with thinking about time in advance, such as looking time frequently or setting the alarm.
it is rare that you always success in your life even if you keep endeavouring.
i will try to make a little more efforts without giving up.
originally, i'm a left-hander.
but my mother forced me to use right hand.
i had to use right hand when she supervised me.
as a result, i can not write word with left hand but i can not draw a picture with right hand.
i've been working at the english preschool in warsaw since november.
i feel like a mentally unstable person cause i experience as much emotions here in one hour as in one month working at the office.
i have this strong feeling that last sentence is totally wrong but i'm learning to talk and don't make my fear of making mistakes stop me before using the foreign language.
i'm slightly lower than average, and am quite fond about chemistry.
you might ask me.
then, my large, snow-white colored curved horns.
most people mistake me for a tiefling, althought i am not!
is anyone interested in exchange language through skype tomorrow?.
no matter what time, complete availability for tomorrow.
we started our chat at 11o'clock.
i invited them to have dinner in my city, but they both thought it's too far.
during the chat, yan taught ping how to make up.
ping is on her third year at university, i think it's very necessary for her to learn that.
yan also said, we should to join the students reunions as often as possible, because it's where couples are made.
our days kept going and we all were getting mature, developing abilities to think, ask, and decide.
pinkey had now reached grade 8 too, which means it was her time to stop her education.
she thought like all other girls in sindh that girls are supposed to stay at home and do the household chores.
i every day thought about my education and the limited life.
i put my tongue between my teeth and sought forgiveness from god.
i believe it depends on you either be a victim or a victorious.
i made this kimono for the party!
i made this dress using the used-kimono.
the sleeves of the kimono were too short for me, and i decided to use it for the project.
i love this simple top because it doesn't have a zipper.
i recommend the pattern to beginners.
i changed the three-quarter length sleeve with ruffle from the normal.
i had to make a tie for the instructions but i made the detachable bow instead of it.
i go to "sunks" after dancing lesson.
sunks is name of japanese convenience store.
i come to there almost everyday. the reason why is that my friends is there for gathering.
my friends is almost athlete. runner, swimmer, dancer, and more.
they come to there after training, too.
i'm so excited about it.
robot
if one day, chinese people do not like to have children, and the population is less.
on the street, robots are driving cars, robots are selling movie tickets, robots are singing, dancing, and robots manager most things in our life.
if robots are as smart as men, all professions are not necessary.
it seems to be better.
but it semms a terrible world too.
unless you turn down the heat on a cooker now, the chicken will be tasteless.
turn down the tv and get on with your homework.
if only you were more hard-working!
my cousin is going to set up a company one day.
turn off the road in five minutes.
little did they knew, their child was to be found.
i went to a public high school near my home and then enrolled in a private university that took me an hour by train from my place.
i also started to be interest with a foreign country since i turned to be a university student.
learning english at the language school in brisbane, australia, joining the organization for the international student and i traveled asia and middle east as backpacking travel style for 6 months.
although it has good memory for me now, my family were worried about me on that time.
i think my manager is not a good person because he asked me to do a lot of things even i told him that something wrong with my eyes and i wanted to go to the hospital.
he said it was ok and took care in front of many people but he added my tasks again.
i didn't go to the hospital too because i thought i could keep going.
it was kind of going back to my old days when i was a new person to my company.
the difference was i was working with some nice people than before.
well, i think i shouldn't work for people which is my weakness.
sometimes, people like evil who will frame you when you are weak or be leaning all of it.
anyway, i hope i can take a leave tomorrow.
i have heard that i tend to be distracted and off the topic often when i speak, so i decided to write what i think, like a journal whenever i have a chance.
it's pretty hard for me to organize what i think by writing because i rarely write except simply taking a note of something.
it would be pretty short writing at first and i feel bored sometimes because i am not used to it.
so i work up to it without working too hard from the beginning.
if i stick to it, i will be able to improve organizing my thoughts and speak logically.
one day,a customer from china when she was trying on something one of our japanese staff tried to introduce the item so hard.
but the customer told me the staff was so talkative,she let me so annoyed.
my mother was flying back taipei yesterday.
we went rome, orvieto and several places in barcelona.
i'm very closed to my mom.
talk to my trip in italy.
for example, taiwanese would learn wwii or european history while having historical class in high school.
but, there would be only some paragraphs or several lines.
this trip was my first time to understand a few information about mussolini and hadrianus augustus.
if you guys know any good website about this, please kindly recommend.
we went rome, orvieto and several places in barcelona.

eat delicious food and talk a lot...
i could have really nice time with my friends!
all presents are sweet!
when i correct english entries
of course, we should make efforts to say or write better sentences without resting on our current english skills.
well, when i correct japanese people's english entries, even if they write japanese version, i rarely read japanese.
it's because i want to understand their sentences in english.
since i'm not a native english speaker, i still don't know a lot of english expressions, so i sometimes ask the meaning of certain sentences, but it doesn't mean that those sentences are always wrong.
some english speakers understand japanese well, so when they correct japanese people's english sentences, they might read japanese to make sure the meaning of the sentences.
i read japanese sentences only when they don't make sense at all.
when you write or say a sentence in english, what do you think is most important?
even if you make some grammatical mistakes, if other people understand what you want to say, i think your sentence is fine, and you can communicate with people well.
of course, we should make efforts to say or write better sentences without resting on our current english skills.

one of them is a small firm maneger and one of them is a teacher at a cram school.
a forigner said, "the speech and behavior of individuals is individuial responsible.
i agree but the other hand, i think that an edification is the issue of education.
education shows a big power to give information and let people be happy.
tomorrow i am going to my painting school to show my homework.
i am still painting to try to paint the best piece.
this morning, i found powder snow falling.
however, it turned out drizzling.

what is the thing that can be widely used in education, business, government, family and almost all the
some people claim that the 21st century could not exist without the internet.
for one thing, the children and young adults that use the internet freely might get the wrong information by chance.
the internet is so wide that it includes some wrong information such as violence and pornography.
that information can cause many bad effects on the children and young adults, which are bad for them are growing.
for example, there is some violence information in the internet.
after the
children and young adults watch that by chance, they might follow the violence way from the internet to solve the problems.
consequently, we have to use some kinds of software to block this kind of information.
this highly technical software has already been developed well.
parents can just trust this kind of software in order to prevent children from accessing the blocked websites,
which includes the wrong information.
as the internet is used on the computers, it is related to the computers closely.
the computer is a highly technical machine that sometimes is hard to control.
as a result, some bad things may have loopholes to get into the computer such as the computer viruses.
if the children and young adults use the internet freely without some safe programs their computers will probably be infected with computer viruses.
for example, many years ago, i used my computer on the internet without any safe programs.
one day, i found my computer was abnormal and called a computer expert to look over it.
he said my computer must be infected with computer viruses from the internet and suggested me to use the safe program to prevent the viruses.
used the internet with the safe program every time and never get the computer viruses any more.
furthermore, by using some filters we can save a lot of time to distinguish the useful and unnecessary information.
most people use the internet to find and get information.
there are so great quantities of information on the internet that we usually have to spend quite a long time to find the useful information.
whereas, if we use some filters, we can distinguish the useful and unnecessary information easily.
for example, my e-mail box always receives some pornographic junk mail, which are very disagreeable.
however, the internet is such an interesting thing that people who enjoy it may keep on surfing on the net.
people who have little ability of self control will lose themselves in the information highway spending a long time in front of the screen, which is absolutely bad for their health.
some people hold that children and young adults use the internet freely can widen their eyes of the world.
however, i think using the internet with the filters can also get the information much enough to widen their eyes.
most parents do not use the filters because they do not know how useful the filters are.
the filters are so good now that we can choose the different ways to get the different kinds of information.
using the filters can make the limit to help the children and young adults kown more about the things that are useful for them.
if the children and young adults use the internet freely, they may lose their directions.
as a result, they might not only widen their eyes, but also waste a lot of time.
the filters can help us to prevent getting into the websites that we will never use them anyway so that we could widen our eyes of the world by using the filters.
consequently, children and young adults should use the internet with some new advanced programs to get the information easily.
the filters are so good now that we can choose the different ways to get the different kinds of information.

watching movie
to discuss whether an 18-years-old boy killed
disappears gradually by discussion.
we can't deny people by race,poverty,life experience and other aspects.
however, in our country,it's still hard to see this spirit.
power always concentrate on important officer.
by the way,what movie impressd you most?
what about 'he was showboating leading up to'?
'took stock'?
"after winning gold in the 100 kilograms plus division at the london 2012 olympics, riner took stock for the first time."
'went into meltdown'?
"the rio victory also saw calls for riner to look at a career change with ufc fans salivating at the thought of the great frenchman taking his dominance inside the octagon."
if you want to see beautiful scenery, i recommend you to go to cinque terre, if you love the see.

when we were children we usually imagined ourselves being famous actors or musicians.
however, have we ever wonder how their lifes are?
are they really enjoing their jobs?

first of all, famous people have normally huge fortunes.
they can travel wherever they want or buy thing that ordinary people could not imagine.
besides, they can enter to fancy lounges or restaurants where the entry is only allowed for important people.
moreover, they may dress stylishly, no matter the money.
on the other hand, being famous evolves a lot of risk.
they are incredibly exposed and also their private life and their close family.
the society want to know who are their partners or when their babies are born.
some of them had been victims of kidnapping or even murderer as john lennon, which is really scary.
in conclusion, we all see their luxurious lives as the perfect life.
althoug in my personal opinion, if we take into account all the factor for and against, they are not happier than the ordinary people.

abenomics refers to the economic policies which is adovocated by prime minister of japan,abe shinzo.
he advocated three approach for overcoming long-term deflation.
firstly,more aggressive monetary easing from bank of japan
secondly, fiscal policy that allows to revitalize the economics by using natinonal currency.
and ficnally, structural reform.
however, i feel these strategies haven't been successful because average wages doesn't increase.
in addition, he said that address to improve working environment and raising women's wages and states.
but unfortunately these problems still remain to be the same and nothing change significantly.
also he advocate new measure, called discretionary labor system.
i think it's like a flexible work times.
in current situation, this measure will make overtime-working even worse.
it seems to me that it promote an inefficient working style of japan.
i strongly hope that our country's economics revitalize.
we have other difficulties such as aging population and declining birth rates.
last thing i really want to say that the govenment should cut the number of the diet members and lower their salaries.

today i registered myself as a volunteer at the international association in sanda city and started to teach japanese, yay!
my boss is a rare person for japanese, who wouldn't ask his subordinates to work overtimes.
i arrived at the place at 6:20.
she said that they have always been suffered from a lack of teachers.
"several years as a volunteer in asago city" seemed to be an enough qualification.
"do you care about the native language of your students?" that can be interpreted in "do you mind if you are going to teach non-english speakers?"
they couldn't expect me to understand them in their native languages and it worked well.
today, the organiser deployed me with a new student.
at first, i felt a bit nervous at that unfamiliar classroom where nobody knew me.
however, after the session of one and a half hours, when the organiser announced that today's class was over, i was totally happy.
i taught her and said, that she should ask that question only to happy teachers like me.
i hope that she also enjoyed the time learning together.

our days kept going and we all were getting mature, developing abilities to think, ask, and decide.
pinkey had now reached grade 8 too, which means it was her time to stop her education.

i put my tongue between my teeth and sought forgiveness from god.
i believe it depends on you either be a victim or a victorious.
water kept pouring from the pump, and i was lost in thought, with a plate in my hands.
i'm confused how to use "continue" words.

i recieved a warm reception at my new job.

sometimes, i imagine looking up moon from the shallow seabed.

i check if i get e-mails at least once several minutes.
i should never think of my e-mail when i am doing other works to do them effectively.
japanese subculture
i think it reminds you of media contents like anime, manga, and video game.
at the same time, that subculture's shortcoming are pointed out sometimes.
from a viewpoint of immature person like me, people who used to like them but start to alienate and switch to social activities and hobbies seem like those who are desperate to adopt the reality and have no room to think of other things, and eventually throw away their innocent and pure heart.
meanwhile, those contents are being sophisticated now, some of them are enough to be seen as profound.
in comparison to my childhood, japanese subculture could change rapidly and attract a wide range of people.
furthermore, it would play an important role in the future of japan as a competitive strong point.

i reluctantly went to store.
once i exercise then i get motivation.
today is rainy day.
because it would like as little as possible to avoid the wet.
i need to go to shopping to obtain ingredients.
toy with cd's with an elastic cord
this toy is made with a thick elastic cord that i had boughth at a sailingboat shop.
daan likes it to hit against the cord and the cd's and he also likes it to pull on the elastic cord en let it go.
he also goes with his hand to the disks to let them spin.
actually i had planned to make this toy on an wooden stand but for now it is an elastic cord that i have to fix on the toys-bow that belongs to his wheelchair.
in the mean time i have made a lot of toys with such an elastic cord.
i will wait for my feelings to rise.
leaning language
today, i'll talk about learning the language.
i'm learning english and you guys also must be learning some languages because you are using this website.
i've been in australia for a year and 4 months and it's my the first abroad.
my english is much better than when i was in japan but, it's still hard to talk with native speakers because they speak so fast and connecting words and words.
so listening skill is one of the big issues for me.
if there are subtitle on when i talk to people, it's going to make it easier.
what is the hardest point when you learn the language?
learning language is really long way, but it'll grow me up a lot and always show me another world.
i think there is no solid limitations for human being.
if you feel something impossible, if you have a mind to change the situation, you should strive against it.
perhaps you can do it until today or tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
report on social problems social problems in my country
the purpose of this report is to list the main problems my country have as well as their causes and consequences so that they are covered on the documentary that the television company i am working for is preparing on this issue.
however, when people are asked about what worries the most, they have no doubt about it; the unemployment, especially amongst young people, and the high levels of pollution.
it was then, however, when they decided that it was time to work outside the home.
not having enough jobs for everybody made unemployment increased and even these days, the country remains having this problem.
that is why, despite being spain a very sunny and windy country, we have continued relying in fossil fuels.
this issue will also entail that they will have children late and as result, the spanish population will age.
as for pollution, many spanish cities are already suffering its first consequences; people having more breathing problems, cars banned from entering in city centres and more forest fires than ever.
if the government do not invest more money in renewal energies, the most likely scenario will be that spain will become a desert.

however, when people are asked about what worries the most, they have no doubt about it; the unemployment, especially amongst young people, and the high levels of pollution.
e., the country has the highest unemployment rate in it.
not having enough jobs for everybody made unemployment increased and even these days, the country remains having this problem.
this issue will also entail that they will have children late and as result, the spanish population will age.
to try to improve the high levels of pollution, the government should encourage people to use public transport and environmentally friendly vehicles rather than be so dependent on their old cars.

i like to drink in a coffee shop, but also like to buy favorite beans and grind it in my house.
there are some people who succeeds in work.
they earn decent wages, get a fame and are looked up to by everyone around him.
however, i don't have a sense of responsibility and a leadership.
i wonder if earning decent wages, get a fame and being respected by people are my true wish.
i feel the anxiety when i see our master.
in which both the change of profession and not be a teacher i think that she need something another.

i went on one day trip to the hot spring last weekend.
this month is birthday month for my boyfriend.
we go to the trip in february and september every year.
last year we went to saipan, this year, i also had wanted to go abroad.
but my tooth decay got worse and i have to pay expensive treatment cost.
but, hot spring was good.
i like to submerge an outdoor hot spring when chilled winter.
if you have a time, let's go to hot springs.
now is the best season for go to the hot spring!!
so far i haven't bought it by myself.
however, i should have had my company paid for it.
since he likes to listen unhappy stories, he smiled while he was listening my poor iphone story.
it is difficult for english learners to answer a question in english that they can't even answer in their native language, unless they prepare for what to answer in advance.
i've had a difficulty to answer when i had a job interview in my current job.
i was asked this question from an interviewer that '' why do you want to work here?", what i said was " well, as you can see, my background doesn't relate to your job, but i was inspired of outdoor advertisments when i visited to ny.
there were a banch of ads there, they had a good design with a creativity, and i thought that how atrractive the ads are.
it made me feel that i want to involve in them and evolve them into farther ads.
after i came back to japan, i started looking for a job in an ourdoor advertising company, and then i found a job offer of your company."
after i answered, the interviewer asked me that " what can we expect if we hire you?" i answered the that " i'm not sure if i'm capable of contributing and making a profit because i don't even have an experience working in sales department, but i have an exceptional communication skill that i can cover a lack of the experience.
i'm sure i can have a further relation with your clients using the skill."
"no, it is impossible at least several decades.
although china has developed its economy remarkedly over the past few decades, it still has lots of problems.
while the rich enjoy the benefit of the economic development, there are still the poor in need for financial aid to get the minimum happiness.
some of the poor are even illiterate and don't have enough money to get private education."
"but, you can see huge wealth gap everywhere in the world.
"to be a global leader, a country should be more open-minded in terms international relationships because the leader should consider the benefit of the whole members.
"i got your point.
but i think it's beside a track.
to be an economic leader, a country doesn't have to get great leadership.
all it needs is absolute economic power, which derives from plenty of natural resources, labor force and etc.
"i would say kind of power shift is going on in the world.
a few decades ago, it was great britain that led in the world.
now, china is building its presence as a leader in the world.
the co2 emission from china is highest in the world, which means it is damaging the earth
planet earth is screaming because of co2, which could result in the suffering of we human beings."
china is actually shifting to an environmental-friendly country.
"hmmmmm, why don't we discuss this topic over cups of coffee later?"
do you know the comic called "jojo's bizarre adventure"?
it's a japanese comic written by hirohiko araki and it has lasted over twenty five years.

in addition, star platinum can stop the time in 2 second.

this title is derived from the song, but i try to think about what i want.
that's the workplace that each person consider of others.
in the terrible one, each person is tired of working there, so they wouldn't do anything but their duty.
they never try to help other people because it just means that they have to work more.
by doing things right, they would feel left holding the bag.
however, i think, the more we help each other, the easier we can work.
that's the workplace that each person consider of others.
i want something just like such workplace.

the rules of game are following.
number of players in the game more than 2.
the player who said a noun not satisfying the rule are loser and dropped off by the game immediately.
and the player who cannot say any noun is also loser.
if all nouns are said, the game is finished.
the players who could continue to say a noun satisfying the rule is winner.
the rule must be decided carefully.
a good rule is that anybody can easily judge whether said noun is ok or not.
so, let's play the simulation of the game.

cities are increasing in population and as a consequence, some neighborhoods are crammed and that it would have give us as a result developing people social skills.

the peoung chang olympic was finally held in korea and i'm enjoying watching this these days.
watching the games is always exciting and i can't stop watching them once i start watching them.
especially i can't take my eyes off when i watch the games such as speed skating and short track because they are the games which korean are good at.
today i watched the medal ceremony award of korean women short track team.
they got the gold medals and looked very happy and emotional.
yes, they have prepared this game for a long time, at least over 4 years and they were picked up as the members of the national team among many people.
i heard that the process of the practice is very hard.
at the same time it got me thinking like "when is my olympic day?" and i thought like if there is the day, i also have to prepare the day hard like them to get the best day ever in my life.
it is easy for people to compare other people's lives with themselves.
since i am a human as well, i started comparing my process of thought with my life.

nowadays a great number of commuters and business travellers have decided that they can work from railway carriages as successfully as they do it from their offices, making phone calls.
other railway companies are not eager to take steps against those who treat the carriage as their personal office space preferring to rely upon ostracism by fellow passengers.

after that, i went to a cinema and watched an interesting movie.
haha, chinese people are really enthusiastic to receive the guests, and one of our most important event to receive the guests is to invite them to have a great diner.
do prepare a great appetite when you are in china: too many delicious foods to taste!
concerning media, i myself can feel this kind of manipulation, like i said in your class, i read news in english, french and chinese to broaden my vision and learn languages at the same time.
however, sometimes i feel the reports about china are often biased, which is the same case about chinese media when they report things in the west.
so maybe this is a bonus of learning the new language: we know more about the whole world in different voices and ideologies.
*when i went to a bank, it had already closed it.

after weeks of mutual discrepancies and reproaches between jxcat and erc on the formation of a new government, both parties appear to be close to reaching a final agreement.
sources of the negotiations said that puigdemont would lead a symbolic republican government in brussels aimed at internationalizing the catalan cause while someone else with executive powers would do the same in catalonia.
nevertheless, puigdemont would still hold the responsibility of the designation of the government and the power to decide on calling new elections at any given moment.
first, pro-independence parties would use their absolute majority in parliament to proclaim the legitimacy of puigdemont to be president.
right after, he would nominate a candidate for investiture as a head of government to exercise the functions of president of catalonia, but with republican criteria.
however, this move would allow pro-independence parties to confront the spanish government within the current spanish legal framework and internationalize the catalan case.
thus, the third option and the most feasible one would be elsa artadi, who could have the responsibility of leading the country for the next four years.
after i left there, i was walking through in front of mcdonald, i had a sudden urge to eat french fries, but i was restraining myself from eating it for my diet.
recently, my pants have no space and needless to say, i've put on weight.
so, i'm even seriously thinking that i have to go on a diet.
when i was riding my bike and almost passing through a flower shop on my way home, many beautiful different kinds of flowers piqued my interest and i couldn't help but stop.
a shopkeeper came toward me and said to me, "how may i help you?" i asked him giving me his recommendation of flowers for my small flower bed.
about two years ago, i found a bud that i have never seen before suddenly appeared in my flower bed and it grew very fast.
it became about 2 meters high and the symbol tree in front of my house.
i thought it was a bird's work.
i looked for the name on the internet.
it was a tree called, "shimatoneriko" in japanese and "evergreen ash" in english.
unfortunately, because of the typhoon last october 22, the tree leaned forward badly.
my husband uprooted the tree because it might damage to our building itself.
it might be my fault or because of the tree.
even though i didn't want to stay there for such a long time to bother his work, i think i was there for thirty minutes or so.
finally, i bought three packages of different kinds of bulbs.
according to the shopkeeper, they don't need extra work, so all i should do is plant and leave them as they grow.
i will take care of those flowers very well as my best.
this afternoon i went shopping.
i saw some flowers at a supermarket, but i didn't buy anything.

i was wondering how many meters more the tree would grow.
i had kinda mixed feelings, though.

listening to this situation, the shopkeeper kindly gave me a lot of good advice.
even though i didn't want to stay there for such a long time to bother his work, i think i was there for thirty minutes or so.
since there were no other customers, i guess the shopkeeper was also happy to talk to me.

they consider that the results of the latest election do not allow them to take unilateral steps any longer.
at least not until the support for independence reaches more than 50% of the votes in an election.
i had the same problem few years ago and i finally found my healthy balance.
i might say it was a hard time for me to get use to all of these changes.
secondly you should walk to your job it is the easiest way to work out when you do not have a huge free time schedule.
do not be desperate.
a bad habit: watch video clips too much.
one of bad habits i want to get rid of is that i watch video clips excessively.
regardless of youtube clips or tv shows once i jump into that visual, i find myself spending much more time than i expected.
the problems are not only it takes my bunch of times, but also it entails other bad effects.
for instance, bad posture brings me a stiff neck.
two, the eyes go dry.
i read somewhere else.
those passages drove me to ponder it tonight.
i have a t-shirt printed ' navy'.
how do you think of this logo?
i bought this t-shirt at korea long time ago.
what does 'navy' means?
i will throw out my t-shirt if that logo has wired meaning.
i have only 4 days to go before studying abroad.
honestly, i'm feeling mixed of nervous and excited now, so i'm trying to being positive and have confidence in myself.
today, i want to write about japanese job hunting culture because i can't explain well in english.
japan has unique system of job hunting.
japanese companies prefer to recruit new graduates and many they simultaneously hire new graduates once a year.
one of the reasons they prefer to hire new graduate is they are easy to train to fit their corporate culture.
so new graduates have a andvantege in job hunting in japan and most of them start woking soon after graduating.
usually, in their senior year, they start prepareing for job hunting like attending career seminars and this job hunting generally continues in the june or july in their senior year.
during job hunting period,most of them dye their hair black and wear in black suit.
it looks really strange and lack of individuality.
in addition, most of them even don't come to university until finishing their job hunting.
but i hope this explanation could make it sense.
the second option would be jordi turull, who will also probably be suspended by the spanish supreme court in a few months.

she led his campaign for the dec.
21st election and is also currently leading the negotiations of jxcat with erc.
presumably, her election as president would allow puigdemont to hold the executive power of catalonia since she would be willing to be directed by him at a distance.
as for the formation of a government, jxcat and erc are decided to split the portfolios 50-50 and each party will decide on its own ministers.
they consider that the results of the latest election do not allow them to take unilateral steps any longer.
at least not until the support for independence reaches more than 50% of the votes in an election.
there was a rumor about a love affair between my former boss and my former co-worker.
they are same age and they've been working together more than 10 years.
moreover, both of them like playing golf and they practiced together.
i know thins because they don't do it only by themselves, they collect other people as well and and practiced it together.
i've been there too.
since they seem they have very close relationship my co-workers saying a lot of things about them behind them, like "are they dating?","no, i've hared that she thinks they are in relationship but he thinks they are just friends.","they are just friends"etc...
my opinion was "they are just friends" because they don't hide their relationship.
they go to lunch together very obiously, they don't go to golf by themselves.
my boss sometimes talked me about her.
i thought if they were in relationship, they wouldn't do those things.
so my conclusion was their relationship was "very good adult's friendship"
surprisingly, on last monday,out of the blue, my co-worker working with him at a different project from mine texted me.
"you already hared...?
they got married!"
this cought me off guard.
to be honest my boss doesn't look like a guy who's interested in marriage.
i thought he likes being loner.
sorry i like delusion.
he uncovered about their marriage only at his project, but couple of days later, most of workers in my company got know about it.
people really like gossips!
i watched the movie called "kick ass 2" on blu-rays this night.
i watched the previous movie day before yesterday and i can't wait to watch it.
"kick ass 2" was actually not better than i expected, because the screenplay was not good.
and i couldn't concentrate in the movie because too many characters are there.
they surely had what they want to do and must do for themselves and other people in their town.
i had been there with them.
i decided, from now on i need to do three things every day.
correcting and posting dairy on site lang8, exercising hearing of foreign languages and reading.
i have written dairy on this cite nearly a year.
i have known many new friends.
during the winter vacation, sometimes i don't know what to do at home.

or, are both of them correct?
reading skill is worse than i imagine
i know my english writing skill does have problems.
but i recently noticed, my reading skill is worse than my writing skill.
if the thing written in it is saying the opposite thing from my understanding which is not necessarily correct, i tend to ignore it.
this is very scary thing.
i don't know how many of things i had ignored.
lucky thing is that i still haven't caused any serious problems.
but i must need to improve my reading skill.

by the time she was there we visit her.
she passed away and right now i regret i didn't drive to her always.
she very felt pain, didn't remember the basic details of her life.

may the worst, i don't know.
every treatment requires the cure.
even the love!
health, family and love is very important part of us.
a half marathon
i have not been doing any exercise for a long time and i had such a fear that i might not be able to run the entire course.
i started practicing running a few months ago, but every time i run, 2 or 3 days after the exercise, my body began aching.
this delayed muscle pain indicates clearly that i am getting old.
also, what makes things worse, my joints get painful.
this is the first experience i have never had in my whole life.
some parts of my body had never had a pain before i practiced running recently.

motivation is a very important thing to make a good performance in a job, but it is hard for us to keep motivated for good.
if i didn't have the goal, my day would become mundane.
i believe that lang-8 is one of the useful instruments for us not only to practice writing in a language we are learning but to be able to exchange interesting information about the difference in culture, history, etc between people from various backgrounds.

however, when i notice that i can't do it in fact, i try to accept my present situation.
that just means i don't have enough ability to let him listen to me.
i easily misunderstand what i really can't do.
if the other person doesn't listen to me, that's not his fault.
that just means i don't have enough ability to let him listen to me.

this high-pitched sound accompanied me on my way towards the valley.
it was interrupted only when the sharp metal edges pushed against the mountain side, making the snow groan softly under my weight, or when my turning manoeuvres caused small avalanches that quietly trickled down the slope.

my back was pushed by the power of something.
the mountain is about 600 meters high.
i started the hiking at 3:00 p.
even though the sunset was at 5:40 p.
i didn't know whether i could touch the top of the mountain and come back to the start point until the sunset, but i decided to go where i ended up.
this mountain is located near the city and has some nice city viewpoints, so i could enjoy the nice and beautiful city views on the way.
the altitude was getting higher, the remaining snow was increasing around the trail way, and then finally the trail way became the white way.
the signboard showed "almost there!" and something showed below the letters"third-grade elementary students in 1983".
my back was pushed by the power of voices that was uttered by the little men 36 years ago.
the words encouraged me and made me feel something heartwarming.
of course, i had reached the mountaintop and could afford to come back the start point until sunset.
i think it was amazing and fantastic things.
i want to remain such behind words that will help someone out in the future.
xiongzhiyi
xiong zhiyi went to chang an to participate in the imperial examinations.
that was the autumn,it had been raining several weeks.
this person was called fan ze, he would attend to the eaxm too.

there is one of my friend who really loves to save his money all the time.
he always tries to find cheap meals because he does not have money for using.
usually, i see that he looks not so happy and the only moment when he looks happy is to check his balance.
although there are advantages to save your money like for your emergency situations, i strongly insist that you should feel happier when you earn money to use it.
one of my friend who loves to save his money does not use it for even what he really needs because he does not like to draw from his savings.
i assume that even after he got old, he cannot use his money because he uses to save his money too much.
on the other hand, once you learned how to use your money properly, you can choose what is really important for you, and what is really necessary for you.
in my country, japan, a lot of people prefer to save their money for the future and they enjoy it.
plus, you can also use your money for getting more money like by investing for yourself, stocks, electric currencies, real estates or anything not just saving it.
for these reasons show, you should enjoy your money when you earn it to use it.
in conclusion, i believe that people should feel happier when you earn it.
not only because does this help to enjoy your life, but also you need to learn how to use your money properly.
usually, i see that he looks not so happy and the only moment when he looks happy is to check his balance.
by just saving your money, you are not able to learn anything.
plus, you can also use your money for getting more money like by investing for yourself, stocks, electric currencies, real estates or anything not just saving it.
actually, this phenomenon is becoming a more serious social problem these days because most people tend to save their money rather than to use it, and consequently, the economic cycles are not going well.
however, i agree with the statement that it is better to enjoy your money when you earn it for following reasons.
there is one of my friend who really loves to save his money all the time.
he always tries to find cheap meals because he does not have money for using.
usually, i see that he looks not so happy and the only moment when he looks happy is to check his balance.
in addition, you should practice how to use your money properly for the future.

studying abroad can learn a great way of perspective.

nowadays, computer games has gained increasing popularity among young people, although playing computer games sometimes can have a harmful impact on their work but it can help young adults to exercise their brain and make more friends.
playing computer games can impair young adults health and therefore have a negative influence on their work.
the first reason for this is that young adults might always play computer games for a lot of hours in a row and feel frazzled and fatigued.
a consequence of this is that they may find it hard to concentrate on their work and can barely finish their job tasks on time.
some video games, such as detective games and drawing games, are designed to develop their brain and therefore allows them to be more bright.
for example, if young adults often play some detective games, the speculative nature of which is likely to enable them to be more analytical and smart in solving real life problems.
likewise, if young adults are addicted to play drawing games, they might tap their potential in drawing.
computer games also play a vital role in building up interpersonal relationship.
for example, young people might meet many friends in some interactive games online and if they become friends offline, they may have a large friend circle and can seek help when they need it, like when they need to borrow money to help out an emergency problem.
all in all, even though game addition may have an adverse impact on their work, it might enable them to be more smart and enlarge their friend circle.

one of the things that make visitors to japan uneasy may be the fact that not a few japanese are wearing masks which looks like surgical ones in a public space.

then japan is the tourism country." indeed many foreigner come to japan and enjoy, but we have to think about those people who do not come to japan.
japan is surrounded by sea and has smaller realm than other continental countries.
in 1960s, japan imported many resources and made many industrial commodity and export it.
but, these days, many japanese factory that are used in 1960s are closed.
it is because developing country surrounding japan improve quality of products and they can produce at low costs.
so we can not win the race of product definitely.
if we do not think how can we get foreign currency in modern society, we must disappear.
then i think tourism is one of the biggest way to solve this problem.
but it is not enough and we have to look at foreigners who do not come to japan.
if we look at and think about them, we can find reasons why they do not come to japan then we can reform or change something for them.
perhaps that change makes foreigners who have ever come to japan happy.
then tourism is very good way to solve problem and if we want to be true tourism country, we have to look at those who do not come to japan.

meanwhile, the main goal of the canadian federal government's policy was to cease the aboriginal culture in the nineteenth century.
as mentioned above, their policy ultimately limited parents to in contact with their children in order to eliminate the aboriginal government and impose the canadian culture of exploitation.
bev sellars refers the indian act as the racist legislation, stating in his book "the 'indians' were put into the same categories as people and the mentally disabled despite any intelligence shown by any individuals." i was very shocked how their rights were ignored and persecuted over a century.
the first nations were obligatorily relocated their reserved from agriculturally valuable land onto remote and economically marginal reserves.
in early 1886, the first nations were discouraged to visit their children at the residential schools as the pass systems, which limits the first nations to go outside of their reserve, were established.
for the same reason, they were banned to celebrate their traditions and family gatherings.
how devastating is it to see their children were injured, traumatized and being missing at the residential schools, especially when they were not able to go out of their reserve or put in jail for nothing?
these facts lead me to think that we must investigate the relationship between the heitsuk first nation and the canadian society as well as the hudson's bay company as a case study, with which they dealt since 1833, to understand their thoughts and characteristics further on what extent they are willing to do a business with the public company.
the first nations have been standing up for their rights until the canadian constitution acknowledges the aboriginal rights in 1982 and still now.
on the other hand, the modern canadian society feels remorse and penitence to the acts of cultural genocide and aims to revitalize good relationships.
as well, the united nation declared on the right of indigenous people in article 19 and 28.
although we cannot undo what our society has done, we now can only strive for re-establishing good relationships with the first nations.
that being said, being chosen by the heitsuk first nation was the sign of the trusting relationships we, the forthright consulting, established over the years.
i would like to propose what is the best for both parties, the marine harvest and the heitsuk first nation regarding the issue of salmon farming.
at the same time, i would like to conclude with the wish to assist the marine harvest to understand our complicated canadian history and apply a culturally appropriate strategy on this matter.
yesterday, i spent too much time on finishing my works, and i arrived at home very late.
processing my work, i came up with the idea that doing over time was as worse as leaving undone tasks on the desk.
i stayed at my office until late recently, to keep the deadlines of my work.
the main reason why i had to linger at late was my slow processing speed.
other colleagues usually go back home finalising their works on time, so i can't avoid to say that my processing speed is very slow.

there are many different opinions whether some young children spend a great amount of their time participating in sports.
to begin with, these days, electric devices such as video games, tablets, and a smartphone has become more convenient and more efficient.
these children can't do some activities as well as studying subject because they don't have fundamental strength.
for example, when i was a kid, i was belonging to the football club.
i had better strength more than other my friends.
i was able to play the sports and study subjects because moderate exercise stimulates our brain.
as a result, i could not only play the sports but also study subjects.
spending time in sports improves our brain.
secondly, spending time in sports keeps the health condition.
for instance, when i was a junior high student, all almost my classmates got flu.
however, i didn't get flu because i belonged to the football club.
since i was a kid, i had a habit of playing the sports.
that's why i couldn't get flu.
thus, playing sports has a lot of merit in our lives.
in conclusion, i strongly assert that it is advantageous for young people to spend a great time of participating in the sports because the sports affect not only our brain but also our body.
it was used to banish tyrannos, but it was also used to hold brilliant politicians in check.

vasa museum
the vasa museum is the mostly offered museum in stockholm.
indeed the museum is individual and interesting one.
in the year 1628 sinked ship was taken out of the sea 333 years later.
the visitors could visit the original ship.
the story of th evessel is memorable because it sinked after 2 kilometres on the first sailing.
the vasa just sailed out the port when fell to the right side near to djurgarden island it sinked soon.
probably the reason of the tragedy was the disproportionately narrow hull.
the crew could not keep in balance the ship.
the ship was tried to taken out from the sea several times in the 17th century unsuccessfully.

i've been thinking paraguay is pretty safe country.
i didn't know some people are also abuducted here too.
i always watch cnn in spanish to learn other accent soi almost never watched paraguayan news.
i like it because for me it means purity, peace and begining of something new.
i was 19 and it was my first time when i went to another city alone just to see the beauty of the world.
nothing especial, just seeing the sights.
since then i like traveling most of all in my life and trying to show to my kids how funny and interesting this was of knowing the world is.
better manage your android libraries with docker
let us assume we have two distincts android projects: first one is a library providing useful methods, and the second one is an android application using this library.
my goal is that my android application uses up to date library with one command only on library project.
here are the solutions i have been through and why i dislike it:
but some servers may not allow override existing versions of library, which will force you to not forget to bump version number each time.
furthermore, you will have to carefully manage versions numbers with the rest of your team in order your update to not be overridden by someone else.
but this would force you to revert many changes before committing your work.
this was my favorite solution from long time, mainly because it perfectly solves this problem.
but installing and configuring a local server for each member of your team may be painful.
furthermore, it will need resources from your computer permanently, as an apache server is generally always running on a computer.
because it solves perfectly the problem, creating a local server will be the solution we will use.
the github project consists in two android projects:
as you hold your wagon's ropes tight in between your hands, you notice how the amount of trees surrounding you is diminishing.
you start hearing a monotone flow of water, and see how a huge metal-made red-colored structure is emerging from your side of the valley and connects with the opposite side of it.
as you keep driving your wagon and approaching the bridge, you also notice how the sounds your horse's hooves produce is slowly turning more metallic, and how your wagon's tremble is losing strength.
you feel a small bump, as your wagon goes on the bridge, quickly followed by the crackles of the wheat you are transporting.
as you are about to get off it, right after feeling another bump, you turn your head toward it's bottom, curious about it's structure.
you notice four metal pillars erecting from it's base and growing toward the violent water's surface, colored with a dull brown color in corners that make contact with the water.

i had the quasi-nationalist pride that marked hip-hop in the '80s.
it is observable, as jay would say, on any martin luther.
we will decide our new team in a meeting.
i bought bundle deal which included flight and hotel on expedia.
it only cost 1,200 dollars for four people, including round trip flights and three nights stay at hotel.
it was our first time to try the airlines.
i found that spirit makes a lot of efforts to reduce the costs.
they don't have cushion on them.
they only have very small table on them.
today i continued my actions of change my life and i enjoying it.
i watched with my friend the black mirror s4e5.
i am going to talk about a book i read recently.
the title is ' hunt for the wilder people'.
this was the most hit movie in new zealand in 2016, i had watched the movie first and it was great that's why i decided to read the book as well.
i am living new zealand so i could follow some kiwi jokes, accent and location, these were familiar with me.
these reasons made me enhance to read it even i had already known the story.
a summary of the book is an orphan boy was adopted by old couple, then young boy and old guy went to an adventure.
it is like a human drama, however i actually liked it was their sense of humor.
to be honest, i couldn't understand some jokes but could comprehended when i read the book.
i was so happy to finish the book because i don't read an english book often due to my second language.
it is quite tough to concentrate reading english book.
sometime i totally lost 'who is who', however i really enjoyed it because i love the story.
i feel small fulfillment when i enjoyed a cup of tea after i've done dishes,finished laundry and cleaned a room.
the first spaniard who won the olimpic games
this important event for the greeks was celebrated each four years in olimpia.
at the beginning, only greeks disputed the olimpic games until 146 bc when rome stablished greece as part of its imperium.
the culture of the ancient rome was very influenced by the greek culture, and the olimpic games started to be an important event of rome.
athletes of the roman provinces went to olimpia each four years to participate in the olimpic games.

the united states isn't the only country with liberal gun ownership laws - switzerland, that bastion of peacefulness, has lax gun laws too.
this is roughly a quarter of the rate in the united states."
"the weapons law recognises a qualified "right to acquire, possess and carry arms."
members believe that gun ownership is essential to their self defense, whether against criminal attack or government tyranny.
the us, the country which out spends the rest of the world's countries combined on "defense", on the other hand, is bounded by canada, mexico and two vast oceans.
sad to say, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that us culture is inherently violent.
although thick, heavy, monstrous tears fell from my quivering eyes, not even their combined would be enough to smother the flames.
i thought that whatever i was going through god knew about; and maybe he had written my fate to be no different than the millions of other girls in pakistan, who were deprived of their rights.

on saturday i relax, but i get up early.
i read papers and watch news on tv.
i never cook in the evening.
i dinner in a restaurant.

everyone promises things which are impossible to achieve, nobody thinks for people but only for them and for the success of their party.
in italy next month there are political elections.
i'm worried about it because any canidates are a good politician.
everyone promises things which are impossible to achieve, nobody thinks for people but only for them and for the success of their party.
i'll finish internship in six months.
but still need to successfully pass all the exams.
i try to learn english by himself.
registered on this site for a long time, but did not really use it, i do not know how it works and how it usefull and convenient it will be.
i decided to set up camp on the gentle rocky slope of a low cliff, covered sparsely with tall slim pine trees.
somehow i decided that bears and the late twentieth sentury scalp hunters would avoid that cozy place, probably because that stunning view might have been a bit disturbing for their simple minds.
i climbed onto the slope, dropped my backpack on a flat dry rock coated with a loose layer of tiny branches and dry pine needles, took a deep breath and look around.
the sun was going down to have some rest and, probably, to catch up with some friends.
but the sun was still shining over the top of the cliff, painting the endless forest hills and distant rocky ridges warm colors of pink, red and yellow.
i could even recognize a few patches of snow still hiding among the rocks and lowland valleys between the hills.
spring always goes green and naked.
i felt like an old storm-beaten salt stranded on an island full of bloodthirsty savages and ferocious beasts, doing his job with a knowing grin.
after a few attempts and hitting some sensitive parts against the trunk, i managed to climb up into the tree and, at the height of about six meters above the ground, set up a new camp.
i was falling into sleep like an elevator on the loose, being cut off from its cables, into a bottomless shaft.
i popped out of my dreams like a cork from a bottle of sparkling wine.
for a moment, i had no idea who and where i was.
it took me some time to process why i was hanging in a sleeping bag tied to the tree.
little by little, i regained control over my hands and, after a while, over the rest of my body.
i pulled myself together, bent my knees slightly, as i was taught in parachuting courses, and released my grip.
i was cursing myself over and over again.
then i clenched my fists and burst into even more spiteful curses which exist only in the russian language.
sleeping in the tree!
who, the f..., sleeps in a tree?
are you a f...
i was shedding curses like a dying millionaire would have thrown his money to caner funds.
curses, however, were of very little use in my current situation.
insults cannot make people warm or feed them.
where is damn firewood?
there were no gangs of bears or felons in sight rushing to take my life.
if i was gonna die that night then it would have happened not because of bears but because of pneumonia.
i found myself standing on the same rock where i stood during the sunset.
i saw the same landscape, but now it was dull as if painted in pale blue ink.
the silence reigned both outside and inside of me.
my eyes were wondering pointlessly through the night; then, i looked up.
i had never seen the milky way in such glory.
soon, i was sitting near it rubbing my hands and warming up my numb body.
i became a normal, ordinary man who was trying to survive sailing through the endless gale of his consciousness.
my mind was restless that night, like a hungry dog who noticed its owner approaching him with its food bowl...
i had gotten a huge inspiration from what i had just seen and felt.
i mused that in the past there were fewer people and they died easily and frequently.
now there are far more people around the globe, they live longer, but still, die.
the number of deaths, though, never changed.
we just made it turn slower.
i watched a few films on last weekend.
i want to write here about two films which i think the most interesting.
this film about relationships between a famous couturier and his muse.
the cameraman's work is perfect.
the film is full of beautiful close-ups and the lighting seems like a natural and it is also perfect.
i was enjoying of the actors play by daniel day-lewis and vicky krieps.
i'm sure that "phantom thread" will win oscars in a few nominations.
this film about one woman whose daughter has been killed, but the police couldn't find a murderer till seven months.
so, after all the woman was in rage because of the police who didn't do anything for investigation.
the woman bought ad places on the three billboards and placed these texts: "raped while dying", "still no arrests?", "how come, chief willoughby?".
i like idea how the loner hero who is finding justice becomes an antihero.
the hatred breeds hatred.
also i like the actors play, script and characters.

for watching the starry sky, going to the desert will be a good idea.
because, desert's sky is empty of any buildings, skyscrapers, etc.
meanwhile, exactly there you can concentrate on staring at the stars without any city's noise.
i bet you will drown in watching unbeatable stars and huge endless sky.
that time you confess how much human is trivial against the beauty of this greatness!
the mol triumph sailed into the hamburger port at 10 pm on monday.

new song released for draemon's new movie
gen hoshino, japanese famous musician, released his new song, draemon two days ago.
this song was made for draemon's latest movie.
one day was enough for the music clip uploaded in youtube to get more than million views and more than 3000 comments.
there is no doubt this tie-up has boosted his famous further and now various people ranging from kids to elderly love him.
it does not go so far as to say that he is one of the top emerging artists as ever.
in that moment while being held by rainwater, i was enshrined in a sanctuary that hid me from my burdens.
my mind and my senses, having been entranced by the deluge of heavenly water falling down on me, was utterly unaware that my cousins had become fixated on staring at my body through my white,cotton kamiz, which was becoming ever more diaphanous.
however, i couldn't ignore aman wadi's voice.
as my senses returned to the world outside of my brief respite, i noticed that my teenage cousins were staring at my body curiously.
my favorite dress was burning right before my eyes.
although thick, heavy, monstrous tears fell from my quivering eyes, not even their combined would be enough to smother the flames.
she looked at me a moment.
i felt i was too angry and was concerned about being rude, and disrespectful to my mother.
he looked around the mess of dishes and the flames of the burnt clothes.
as soon as i reached the door, i eavesdropped what they were discussing.
to me it seemed as if father followed the religious beliefs that the imam of the mosque admonished to him with a blind faith, never questioning in rational thought for himself or in front of others.
i thought that allah was kind and he loved all human beings, including girls.
i thought that whatever i was going through god knew about; and maybe he had written my fate to be no different than the millions of other girls in pakistan, who were deprived of their rights.
engulfed by a cloak of torrential rain, the grime, heat, anxieties, and tension that had encrusted themselves on my body like a layer of pollution were finally driven away.
my mind and my senses, having been entranced by the deluge of heavenly water falling down on me, was utterly unaware that my cousins had become fixated on staring at my body through my white,cotton kamiz, which was becoming ever more diaphanous.
after changing my clothes, i took the broom and went to the kitchen to sweep the floor and to wash the dishes.
although thick, heavy, monstrous tears fell from my quivering eyes, not even their combined would be enough to smother the flames.
i shouted at mother.

luckily, there is a big bookstore close to the office, so after work, i went there to buy it.
i felt nervous, but i pretended that i enjoyed having a small talk for a while, then we arrived at the building.
i almost forgot to buy an english textbook which i use when i study english on the radio.
i frankly asked her whether she went straight to a station, but she told me that she wanted to go to the building which the bookstore is in.
i felt nervous, but i pretended that i enjoyed having a small talk for a while, then we arrived at the building.
if i had had perfect confidence in myself, i could have told her that i have skill in english.
i'd rather not say anything than say something stupid.
you need to make sure you don't have any of those problems before thinking about doing that.
i never thought that i would be able to write english this much.
i know my english is still weird, but i'm wondering if i became a youtuber, there would be any listener for my videos.
weirdness can be an accent of my character, right?
but, what kind of topic, should i give?
just thinking and imagining don't charge you any money.

noone has ever escaped a war without being hurt someway.
the least is that his or her spirit has been crushed.
why so many violence?
how a human 's spirit can have the capacity for accepting these so many crimes?
this could be understood from word to word of their speech.

the other day, i worked at a hotel in tokyo disney resort for only few days.
i was so crazy for disney until i was a junior high student so i knew all about tokyo disney resort.
a while back, i dreamed to have a wedding ceremony in tokyo disney resort, i applied for its brochure even though i was only 12 years old.
at that time, i was convinced that i will never get tired of disney.

it's hard to me learn especcialy english.
i don't have any oblogation or too high expectations.
i learn yet a week!'.

so first, want to make clear why my students want to learn english.
therefore, i always focuse on helping my students gain self-confidence.
it was a warm thawy day.
on the way to the subway station, i found japanese apricot trees were in bloom and at the same time i caught sight of something under a tree alone.
i picked the glove up and hung it on its branch so that the owner of its stuff could see it.
after getting off the subway, i bought a sakura strawberry pink milk latte at starbucks before i went out the ticket gate, and then, the same thing happened.
there was a man's glove on the floor.
since it was warmer than usual, i supposed the owners took their gloves off on their way and pushed them into pockets or something but they didn't realize one of them slipped off.
that was like a missing sock syndrome, so i decided to call it "a spring missing glove syndrome".
i have a reason to support my opinion.
first, students have much more time than businessmen to use for themselves.
but most of students don't know how to use time very well.
so if i could teach students how to handle time, they will be able to use time without wasting it.
when they do volunteer works, they do something kind using their time for others even strangers too.
that kind of experience makes them kindness person.
it means that volunteer work creates self-improvement on the students.
i think it's better to put volunteer works on the education field.
that is the reason to agree with that idea.
i hope everyone is willing to give a hand to people need help in the future.

i think it is because we're going to hold an olympics in tokyo, 2020, so many people from abroad are interested in our what our culture is like.
a tourism in japan has continued to increase because of it.
it affects also on our economy because they spend a lot of money on many things, so we receive tax from the spent money.
however i'm worried about our economy after the olympics, which will be not as good as the economy we have.
that is why i'm also coucerned about a job industry that i work, which is an advertisment, especially ooh.
that's short for out of home media, which is my job department.
i suppose it will be obsalete or at least we won't make a good profit.
that could make our salary low, and i guess some of employees could be less motivated.
even now, the ooh is not getting popular compared to other advertisments.
i want to avoid these things happened to me, so i change my career by using a good english skill, and get recruited!

western festivals are welcome in china.
it's not surprise to see an impressive tree decorated with lights and stars outside a hypermarket when jingle bells is singing.
the crowd take pictures of themselves with those who dress like santa claus.
for openers, the mixture of different cultures is destined.
china's economy is forging ahead.
many foreign investors not only pump money, but also culture into the rising power.
the tendency of fusing western culture into the the east is unstoppable and inevitable.
second, china has a long history of more than 5000 years and has been through a myriad of wars and manifold invasions of other countries, yet none of them has changed her people and culture.
therefore, some western cultures do bring some fresh air for us, however it wouldn't uproot what our ancestors had left for us.
we respect cultures of every hue, notwithstanding that we have different behaviour and religions.
viewing the coexistence of western culture and eastern culture, the idealist say let it go; the realist say let it be; the rationalist say live and let live.
i'm really appreciate if someone help me.

i have read the novel called higurashi no ki recently.
it is historical fiction novel written by hamuro rin who is from where i live, kokura in kitakyusyu city.
it was published in 2011 and was adapted to the movie afterwards.
so, it was a little ashamed not to read this book until now.
it is a story of the samurai named toda shukoku who is going to be executed by hara-kiri on a charge of commit adultery with one of the mistress of the feudal lord.
the story follows the other samurai named danno shozaburo who is also about to commit hara-kiri on charge of affair involving bloodshed in the castle.
he was exempted from that charge but, he was ordered to keep an eye on shukoku in order to make sure if he would commit hara-kiri.
as he started living with syukoku and helped his works, he gradually got to know him and ended up admiring him.
he was exempted from that charge but, he was ordered to keep an eye on shukoku in order to make sure if he would commit hara-kiri.

it's a bit shame that i've never known such a great man until i saw one of his match against pacquiao.
when people call his name, the word of " money " is put in front of his sir name.
maywhether, he is acutally a living american legend who holds the most splendid record ever of all boxer's records.
we know the total fight money he's earned in all his career, which is an incredibly big amount that also weighs the gravity of his exisitence.
probably there are many kinds of answer for this question.
my answer for this is that if i have many friends, i can do more kinds of things than if i do not.
in my experience, i often climb local mountain alone.
then they know what i did not know and realize many thing that i could not realize even though we used the route what i often use.
for another example, my friends may know the means of solving problem that i did not know and teach that to me.
as i have explained, i can improve my knowledge by my friends' teach, then i can do more kinds of things.

the subject of this paper is to comprehensively analyze the two main pillars of rural relief policy under the grate depression.
however, this movement had serious side effect to the local labor market because it recommended the middle class farmers to reduce the hired labor supplied from the poorer stratum.
the shrinking of the local labor market had to be covered by the public work for poor farmers that of another pillar of the rural relief policy.
therefore, it is said that these two policies had a complementary relationship each other and had policy integrity to some extent.
this paper examines the case of kamisato village, shimoina district, nagano prefecture and clarifies whether this complementary relationship could have succeeded to help the rural farmers who were suffered from the economic damage of the great depression or not.
first, the kamisato village forest with abundant wood resources played an important role to overcome the great depression by providing village residents the opportunity for earning wage income.
second, however, even in the kamisato village, there had been a possibility of rising confrontation between the hamlets where the residents had utilized the village forest in everyday life and the other hamlets where the residents had little experience of working in the forest.
third, the public work for poor farmers financially supported by the central government complemented the job creation in village forest and ease the confrontation between the hamlets in kamisato village.

we need to keep up with changing times because we couldn't survive in this modern society otherwise.
for instance, when we are talking to youths, we need to know the trend among their community.
it seems that minions movies are very popular and watched by the majority of youths, so through referring to trendy topics, we can relate to them and form a good relationship with them.
youths are crucial in creating a new wave in the organization.
older people tend to think traditionally and in the old-fashioned style.
also people high up in the organization are conservative and it is hard to incorporate youths' ideas into their agenda and the way of running their organization.
my complexion is a little bit darker than most of other koreans.
i am quite satisfied with my skin color and not eager to have 'white' skin, which means bright skin in korean, but sometimes i envy 'white' skin, though.
someone might think that korean's preference for white complexion is because of westernized standards of beauty or racism.
we can definitely say big eyes with double lids, a high nose, and long legs, which koreans admire, became determinants of beauty as a result of westernization and influence of mass media.
there is a 'josun' dynasty a hundred years ago, which had lasted for approximately five centuries and there were '9 factors' to be satisfied to be considered as a beauty: white complexion, teeth, and hands; black eyes, hair, and eyebrows; red lips, cheeks, and nails; short ears, teeth, and jaw; moderate intervals of breasts and eyes, and broad forehead; soft and slender fingers, waist, and feet; thin fingers, ankles, and nostrils;nice and thick lips, arms, and hips; long height, hair, and hands.
josun was a kingdom valued scholars over physical workers and warriors.
and scholars who mostly worked and stayed indoor hardly had tanned skin.
preference for white complexion might stem from a desire for a higher class, scholars.

i usually think about what to do, but never about relaxing.
as opposed to plenty of free time expected, however, i keep a busy retirement from my hobbies.
one of my hobbies is singing in chorus, and for now i belong to three different choirs.
another hobby i spend a lot of time on is english learning.
i do a lot of activities regarding english, but the thing that required me most is giving a speech for the toastmasters club meetings.
so you see, i have to keep energized to cover all the things day by day.
there has been no room of relaxing in my life.
as opposed to plenty of free time expected, however, i keep a busy retirement from my hobbies.
one of them requires the chorus members to sing without a music on stage, so we have to spend time reviewing and memorizing the music piece, which makes my life busy.
another hobby i spend a lot of time on is english learning.

it was pretty hard to keep up with the pace of reading, and as the deadline came closer, i became tenser.
i do a lot of activities regarding english, but the thing that required me most is giving a speech for the toastmasters club meetings.

some students prefer to study alone. other pefer to study with a group of student.which do you prefer? use specific reasons and examples to support your answer
there are many different opinions whether some students prefer to study alone or others prefer to study with a group of student.
in my opinion, i prefer to study alone rather than with a group of student because it is more advantageous to study alone than with a group of student.
i feel this way for several reasons, which i will explore in the following essay.
to begin with, there are some the way of studying especially, alone or group.
studying with a group of student sometimes help us teach some subjects each other if i don't know about knowledge.
however, studying with a group of student can't focus on studying for exams.
also, i got distracted to study that.
finally, they start talking about something instead of studying.
on the other hand, studying alone is able to concentrate on studying subjects.
even if something can't understand, it is easier to get a lot of information from the internet using a smartphone.
for example, when i was a high school student, i always studied alone at home or library.
i could focus on studying the subject as well as do thorough reviews over and over again.
as a result, i got a special license and result.
if i studied with a group of student, i couldn't get that.
secondly, studying alone is able to learn things at my own pace.
we can manage time schedule depends on health condition.
nevertheless, studying with a group of student can't study time schedule on my own. we must care about other students.
the way it is not efficient to study with a group of students compared to study alone.
for example, i studied my friends when i was a university student, actually, i got a cold, but i promised to study together with my friend because he couldn't understand this chapter.
however, i wasn't able to pass the exam of a chapter because of a nasty cold.
in conclusion, i strongly that people prefer to study alone rather than with a group of students because studying alone can not only focus on studying but also manage time schedule.
i just realized my net income is way less than i expected.
i didn't think the tax and all were that expensive...
it's been a very long time since i wrote my latest diary.
actually it's been 3 months already tt
1st semester is over.
it's spring break now.
thank you for your hard work until such late time
i have studied english very hard now,because i have university entrance examination in a week!
these days, i realize that nothing is more important than fundamental ability when i study english.
for example,memorizing words,checking grammar,and so on.
when i read long thesis that was used in exam,i could not catch the meaning though i had studied advanced technique of rapid reading.
then,i took word flashcard and worked on it hard.
i completed flashcard with taking a week and read that thesis again,i could catch the meaning more clearly,rapidly and easily!
this realization is very important in my means of studying.
i think that the same is true in many case,so i make good use of it and improve my study efficiency.
cell phones should be allowed in school.
i think cell phones should be allowed in school.
first,cell phones have many useful function.
if you use it,you can improve your work efficiency.
for example,when you find words that you have never seen,you can use cell phone in order to search the meaning of the words and you can do it more faster than using paper dictionary.
it applies wherever you are,of course in school.
second,student can use cell phones in the class without checking mails or sns.
but,young people have better knowledge to get along with cell phones than aged people.
so you have to believe students and allow it.
in conclusion, cell phones should be allowed in school because students have good sense and can improve efficiency.
admitting one's mistake
it's very hard for us to admit our mistakes, because we usually do things which we think right.
however, we don't have enough time to consider whether these are really right, so we often make mistakes.
if we really did each thing, we wouldn't do anything.
and we also should be generous to others' mistakes.

this book presents japanese history, tradition, law and manners in that time.
it shows to me how different point of view and behaviour people, who lived in that time had, compare to people who lived in europe at the same time.
i know that, even now it is big different between people's mentaly from european and asian, but it seems to me that this different decreases each century.
maybe it is globalization's effect, more interaction beetwen many cultural, what gives better understanding each other.
on the one hand i would like go back in time for a while, and see how different world was, because books don't tell us many things, but on the other hand, in medieval times countries and nations were more closed for foreigners people and it was harder to explore.

these will shorten your work time.
so you will get more free time, right?
however, we can buy the time to a certain extent.
